🇯🇵 神性についての内なる問い

**誰がこんな風に考えたのか?**

何かが痛みを生み、何かがその苦悶に火を注いでいる。──その根にあるのは、至高の歓喜への潜在的な観念ではないのか？永遠に続くこの「期待」──
崩れゆくものに飾りを重ね、死の前触れのように脳裏に巣くうこの思考──それは虚飾という名の同伴者ではないのか？ああ、憂鬱という脾臓から生まれたこのみすぼらしい思想よ、どうすればおまえを食らい尽くし、魂を救うことができるというのか？それでも、いつも答えは返ってくる。「しかるべき場所に礼を尽くせ。医者こそが存在の主である」と。だが、この医療という迷信は……臆病さの本質であり、死の代理人ではないか？

奇妙なことに──「死んでいたときのこと」を覚えている者は誰もいない。あなたは太陽を見たことがあるか？あるのなら、“死”を見たことなどないはずだ。あなたのどんな信念があろうとも、死んだものなど見たことはない。では問おう──今この場にいる「あなた」と、そこに横たわる「死体」どちらの方が“死”に近い？どちらがより意識的だろう？表情だけを見て判断するなら──いったいどちらがより「人生を楽しんでいるように見える」だろうか？この「死」への信念こそが、あなた自身の“死にたいという意志”なのではないか？その信念が望んでいるのは「眠り」「腐敗」「変化」、あるいは「地獄」ではないのか？この“絶え間ない夢遊病的状態”──それこそが、「満たされなさ（dukkha）」なのだ。

あなたは幽霊も神も「見たことがない」から信じない？──何を言っている。自分の信念が生み出した“嘲笑う幽霊たち”を、まだ見ていないとでも？謙虚さの名を借りた狂気の哄笑（ベドラム）、欲望の神（マモン）にひれ伏す毎日──あなたの「自己」というグロテスクな観念そのものが、すでに亡霊ではないのか？そうだ──あなたのあらゆる機能、そして最も勇敢な“嘘”たちですら、それらもまた「神々」だ。ならば問おう。あなたの神々を殺す者とは、誰なのか？それもまた──神である。

There is no proof that you existed before? What an excuse! No one has returned to tell us? What a
damning advocate! You are but what you were-somehow changed? You are the case Prima Facie that
you are reincarnated to perhaps anything? "Perhapses" are possible! Can you do differently to what
you do? Never shall I tire of asserting that you constantly do differently!

What is the "ugliness" that offends? Is it the vague knowledge that you will have to change your
mind-that you are germinating what you contain? You are always remembering what you forgot; today
may be the day of reckoning-of believing by force what you disbelieved? Now if to-day is
yesterday in all but appearances-then to-morrow also is to-day- the day of decay! Daily is this
universe destroyed, that is why you are conscious! There is no Life and Death? Such ideas should be
less than comic.

**There is no Duality?**

You are conscious of the gay Butterfly you observe and are conscious of being "You": the Butterfly is
conscious of being "itself," and as such, it is a consciousness as good as and the same as yours, i.e., of
you being "you." Therefore this consciousness of "you" that you both feel is the same "you"? Ergo,
you are one and the same-the mystery of mysteries and the most simple thing in the world to
understand! How could you be conscious of what you are not? But you might believe differently? So,
if you hurt the Butterfly you hurt yourself, but your belief that you don't hurt yourself protects you
from hurt-for a time! Belief gets tired and you are miserably hurt! Do what you will-belief is ever its
own inconsistency. Desire contains everything, hence you must believe in everything-if you believe at
all! Belief seems to exclude commonsense.

There is no doubt about it-this consciousness of "Thee" and "Me" is the unwelcome but ever ready
torturer-yet it "need not be so" in any sense! Is it not a matter of Fear? You are fearsome of entering a
den of Tigers? (And I assure you it is a matter of righteousness-(inborn or cultured)-whether you
enter voluntarily or are chucked in, and whether you come out alive or not!) Yet daily you fearlessly
enter dens inhabited by more terrible creatures than Tigers and you come out unharmed-why?

**The Allegory.**

Great scientists are finding out the death-dealing properties of the microbes they discover we breathe,
and which according to their canons should destroy; we should be already dead? Have faith! The
canons of science are quite correct, they do not disappoint the doubt! Our greater familiarity-"this
impulse to knowledge" will certainly bring us the disease and death they give! And also give us in
compensation their powers of destruction! For the destruction of whom? Things will be squared! Is
this the value of the will? This "will to power"-how life preserving! How furthering of discriminate
selection! How pleasing! Most noble explorers! O, you scientists-go on discovering the Bottomless
Pit! When you are sodden with science-the lightning will thunder out the murder? New hope will be
born? New creatures for the circus? (The conception of) God-head must ever evolve its inertia for
transmutation to its very opposite-because it contains it!

The master must be the painful learner of his stupidity?

The idea of God ever means the forgetfulness of supremacy and Godliness. So must be supplanted by
fear, eh?

There is no Atheist, no one is free from auto-biography, there is no fearless pleasurist?

The conception is the absence of its indisputable reality within! When the conception is memorial in
forgetfulness-it may be the chance of its reality for you?? When the prayer-(you are always praying)
has transmutated to its Blasphemy-you are attractive enough to be heard-your desire is gratified!

What a somersault of humility!
Whether God is projected as master by fear or as the dweller within by love Gods we are all the time,
that is why divinity is always potential. Its constant generation, the eternal delay-is life. This envy of
the Master or Creator-the ultimate hope to follow in manner is also existence and the forfeiture of
"Life"!
There is no scientific fact, it ever implies its opposite as equal fact, this is the "fact." Then why
trouble to prove anything a fact? This vain hope to prove finality is death itself, so why humbug the
"Desire"? You have proved (by mathematics!) the sun to be so many millions of miles away from
you-you will now improve its efficiency! Nature-that impulse to the antitheses of your truths, will
early prove (by mathematics and whenever you like!) that the Sun does not exist at all! Or if you
wish-it will prove conclusively that the Sun is millions of millions of miles further away or millions
of miles nearer than you once thought! Most extraordinary thinker! These facts and many others are
already know to the butterfly, the lice, the insects-and perhaps yourself? Whose senses are the more
true-yours or the house-fly's? You will eventually adopt their vision-their thoughts and wisdom-you
were such once? You are such now but have not awakened them-you will be such again in power!
Wondrous progress! Most meritorious accomplishments! Most merciless! Progress should be closely
examined and what you have gained by the convenience of science.

A thought for perspective-you are always what you most wish-the prospective! Your desire is to live
according to your desire, and this you are always realizing! Most noble sentiment!-you are "it"
already-"the satisfied"-"the desireless"-"the real thing"! You are drunk with it.

There is no illusion but consciousness! This consciousness is ever the smiling monument
commemorating "Whether you ever really enjoyed Life"!

The God of the "Will" is the command to obey, its Justice everyone fears-it is a Sword-your desert for
obedience! "Will" is the command to believe, your will is what you have believed actively willing the
belief for you! You think when "it" wishes! "Will" is complication, the means of a means. Call this
will free or not-beyond will and belief is Self-love. I know of no better name. It is free to believe
what it desires. You are free to believe in nothing related to belief. The "Truth" is not difficult to
understand! The truth has no will-will has no truth! Truth is "will" never believed-it has no truth!
"Could be"-is the immediate certainty! This haunting Sphinx teaches us the value of the "will to
anything"? Then there is no graver risk than Absolute Knowledge-if little is dangerous-what about
Omniscience? The Almighty power has no accessories!

Science is the accursed doubt of the possible, yea, of what does exist! You cannot conceive an
impossibility, nothing is impossible, you are the impossible! Doubt is delay-time-but how it punishes!
Nothing is more true than anything else! What are you not-you ever answered truthfully?

You tyrannise over yourself, so constantly forget what you remember; you resist sense objects and
show resistance to the faculties by believing or not. These faculties are as numerous as the atoms you
have not yet seen, and they are as endless as the number one-they come into life at will. You adopt a
few at a time- knowledge you speak through them- did you but understand your grammar those you
disown speak louder than your words! I would not believe the wisdom of the Almighty.

Belief is ever its own tempter to believe differently; you cannot believe freedom but you may be freed
from belief? Neither can you believe the "Truth" but you need not compromise yourself. The way of
Life is not by "means"-these doctrines-my doctrines even though they allow the self-appointed
devotee to emulate my realization- may I ever blush! The man of sorrows is the Teacher! I have
taught- would I teach myself or thee again? Not for a gift from Heaven! Mastership equals learningequals
constant unlearning! Almighty is he who has not learnt and mighty is the babe- it has only the
power of assimilating!

The most solecistical of fools now asks-"how can we escape the inevitable evolutions of conceptionas
all is ever conceiving"? My answer shall permit all means, all men, all conditions. Listen, O, God
that art, yet would be God. When the mind is nonplussed- capability to attempt the impossible
becomes known; by that most simple state of "Neither-Neither" the Ego becomes the Silent Watcher
and knows about it all! The "Why" and "How" of desire is contained within the mystic state of
"Neither-Neither" and common-sense proves it is the milk state, most nutritious! Clownish that I amyet
all my ideas have come out of it (and, my friend, all yours), but ever have I been a sluggard- an
old sinner who would see others almighty before himself.
