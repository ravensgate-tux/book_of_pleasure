彼の言う「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー（Neither-Neither）」の真価――**あらゆる概念の“中止ボタン”**としての機能


---

🇯🇵 自己愛を語る前に

正直になろう。あなたは「それ」──最高の自由の中にある、最も望ましく、欲望を超えた存在であり、「六つの迷妄（stupifiers）」にすら触れられない。性のエネルギーは働きつづけ、欲望によって死が刈り取ろうとする。感覚が生み出す幻想は危険だ。それは、あなたが正しさ（righteousness）を学び、それに従い、抑えようとしてきたからだ。地獄の炎が燃えるのは、あなたが「概念化」したからだ。そして、その炎が痛まなくなるのは、あなたがエゴ（自我）をすべての可能性と同一視できたとき──「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー（Neither-Neither）」の実践によって信じたとき、である。あなたは炎でありながら、炎に焼かれている──なぜか？それはあなたが「信じようとした」からだ（たとえ違うかたちであっても、それは変わらない）。信念の循環は止まらず、つねにあなたを巻き込む。だからいつか、あなたは違う信念を抱くことになるだろう。そのとき、炎はあなたを焼かなくなる──救われた、というわけだ。──でも、他の痛み方もあるのでは？

「存在しない」その状態において、あなたが“KIA”であるという自覚──それすらない。KIAとは、荘厳でありながら、いかなる定義の範囲も超えた存在。そこには「自由への誘惑」すら存在しない。
KIAは進化の原因でもなければ、時間にも属さない。意識や無意識、「すべて」や「無」──そうしたものを超えている。わたしはこれを、「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー（Neither-Neither）」の働きを通して知った。それはあらゆる概念を自動的に超えており、つねに、あらゆる意味において自由である。あるいは、このKIAは、「無垢な手を通して、かすかに感じ取られることで」曖昧な余韻のなかに現れるかもしれない。──だが、そんな単純な真理を理解できる者が、いったいどれほどいるだろうか？KIAは決して知覚されない。それは「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」がもたらす、知覚不可能なエクスタシーである。つねに「ここ」に在りながら、「一なるもの（Unity）」の循環によって疲労に覆われ、見えなくなってしまっている。意識の確かさとは、つねに「知覚されたもの」「経験されたもの」の不確かさである。そこにあるのは、絶えざる疑い──恐怖、痛み、腐敗、そして進化を引き起こす原因としての、永遠なる「未完成」だ。

おお、欲望よ──聞け。精神的な欲望も、肉体的な欲望と同じくらい猛毒である。「崇高なるもの」への憧れ──それは、内なる臆病さが編み上げた“致命的な欲望の網”である。つまりそれは、満たされない知恵（不全の賢さ）が生み出したものだ。

欲望は──“展開（進化）される”のを待ち続け、そのたびに、苦しみを生み出す。最終的な「知恵」など存在しない。最終的な「欲望」など、存在しない。いったい、何が終わるというのか？「今日（きょう）」は終わったか？それらはすべて、“終わりなきもの”なのだ。誰かが「この世のもの」を欲する──では、「至高のエクスタシー（Supreme Bliss）」を欲するのは、どう違うのか？どちらがより利己的なのか？どちらが、あなたに近いのか？どちらが“創造主”を喜ばせるのか？あなたは「創造主の意志」について確信しているのか？そして、自分の欲望についても確信しているのか？あなたは創造主なのか？　それとも、自分の“中身”を勘違いしてるだけなのか？

これらすべての欲望は、たとえどれほど壮大でも、やがてあなたの中に「具現化」され、写真のように焼きつけられる（incarnate / photograph）だろう。それらはすでに存在している。もうすぐ、スピリチュアルな「写真」（偽りなき記録）が手に入る。──ただし、それはいま君が使っているカメラではない。最初に進む者は、いつだって“老いた愚者”だ。（あとがき：ある霊はすでに撮影されている──それが「微生物（microbes）」というわけだ。）

**あなたは、〈望み（desideratum）〉から本当に自由になれたことがあるか？信念とは、永遠に続く欲望そのものだ！**

欲望とは、それ自体が残酷さである。──それは、知らぬ世界で労働せよと手を縛る苦役の鎖。「無」はつねに“死”んでおらず、いかなる思考も完全には“死なない”。支配者は奴隷に、奴隷は支配者に──その立場は、交互に入れ替わる。あなたはずっと、そう信じてきた。それは世代の肉体に刻み込まれており、最も容赦なき裁き主とともに存在している。

あなたの改革や価値転倒のすべてを嘲笑うもの──それが欲望だ。この呪いと冒涜の連続──だがむしろ、それを課す「新たな冷酷な主（taskmaster）」の存在を知ることが、唯一の救いではないのか？私たちの肉体はすでに、その血にまみれているではないか。この世界は常に血に染まってきた。私たちの快楽とは、屠殺の血を飲むための休息にすぎないのではないか？おお、確信に満ちた嘘つきたちよ──あなたたちはまだ“嘘”を知らぬ。その嘘は、もしかしたら真実かもしれないのに。

エゴとは欲望そのものである。ゆえに、あらゆるものは最終的に「望まれる」と同時に「望ましくなくなる」。欲望とはつねに、恐ろしい不満足の予兆である──ただし、それはいつも**うぬぼれ（虚栄）**によって覆い隠されている。千年王国がやって来る。だがすぐに去る。人は、これまで思い描いてきた神々よりも偉大になるだろう。だがそこには、さらに大いなる不満足が待っている。

>あなたは、常に「かつてのあなた」だ。　──ただし、別のかたちで。

どれほど虚栄に満ち、満足しているように見える個人や国家であっても、ただちに──未知にして不可避な「欲望」へと堕ちていく。その「欲望」は、あらゆる条件を通じて、人を少しずつ──消費してゆく。心は、欲望によって欲望に忠誠を誓い、その結果、欲望を“堅固なもの”としてしまう。──だが、それが実現されたとき、それは「永遠に望ましい」ままでいられるのか？たとえ100万年続いたとしても？

>天国でさえ、おまえの足は鎖に繋がれている。

ゆえに、次のような観念はすべて──取り除かねばならない。

-「欲望は純粋である」とか「汚れている」とか、

-「欲望には達成がある」とか

-「欲望を“ニーチャー＝ニーチャー”によって消し去ろうとしていること自体も“欲望”である」ことすら──

それらすべてが“終わりなき欲望の進化”でしかない。だからこそ、こう宣言される：

>欲望を、いかなる形であっても──「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」によって消し去れ。

「霊」と「非霊」という観念。この区別もまた、何ひとつ有益な結果を生んできてはいない。

>あらゆる概念は、同じ技法で“解除”されるべきである。

この世界（あるいは夢の中）に“避けられぬ束縛”という観念が残っている限り、その束縛は、ずっと存在し続ける。ならば、こうせよ──

>“自由における自由”の瞑想によって、　自由と束縛という発想そのものを「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」で消去せよ。

そして最後に、Spare流の皮肉が走る：

>「吸血行為（Vampirism）という現象は、すでに十分すぎるほど証明されている──　少なくとも、“吸血コウモリ”が存在するという事実によって！」

だからといって、それが「神」や「人間」がやっていない保証にはならないだろう？

ゆえに──欲望を“KIA化（Kiaize）”せよ。「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」によって。それは「満足」など遥かに超えた、“すべてを包みこむ空白”である。そこでは、あらゆるものが“常識”にまで簡素化され、この宇宙そのものが、それに依拠して立っている。だからこの本に書かれていることも、一切、信じる必要はない。「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」によって。そして「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」すらもまた、「ニーチャー＝ニーチャー」で消し去るのだ。「必要なし・どうでもいい（Need-not-be / Does-not-matter）」──それが、“自分を喜ばせるための結論”である。

人はいつだって「意志の真理（The Will）」としてこれを信じている。──信じているのは「対象」ではなく、「意志そのもの」だ。なぜなら、“目的のための手段”とは、果てしない「手段の進化」でしかないからだ。この驚くほど単純な境地においては、「知恵の始まり」も「終わり」も存在しない。どんな事物にも始まりも終わりもない。だから、それが「概念」や「知性」に関連づけられることなど──あり得ないのだ。


**Self-Love as a Moral Doctrine and Virtue.***

The criterion of action, is freedom of movement, timeliness of expression, pleasuring. The value of a
moral doctrine is in its freedom for transgression. Simplicity I hold most precious. Are not the most
simple things in the world the most perfect, pure, innocent, and their properties the most wonderful?
Hence it is the source of wisdom. Wisdom is exactly happiness. In love pleasuring myself necessarily
without excuse. Is this not perfection? Actions would appear unfathomable and incomprehensible,
did they exhibit conformity to the great purpose. There are few who can attain to this! Who has no
shame? Ecstasy in satisfaction is the great purpose. Freedom from the necessity of law, realisation by
the very wish, is the ultimate goal. Law depends on two, two is uberty, millions . . . . Law is
complicated. The second did not agitate, the first did not determine, nor was it compelled or
proffered. Chance in sport is not prophecy; by it we have gained proficiency, sufficient to determine.
. . . .

Prepare for the Eternal, revert to simplicity and you are free. What man can give without
impulse? Only he who has complete sexuality. The highest goodness is self-nourishment. What are
we going to include as self? Perfect charity acquires, hence it benefits all things by not giving. What
man can have faith without fear? Only he who has no duty to perform. When faith perishes duty to
moral doctrines perishes, we are without sin and endure for ever in all-devouring love. What man can
know with certainty? Only he who has effaced the necessity of learning. When teachers fall out, what
is the use of learning from them? The wise are not contentious and have no dogma to expound . . . .
rather are they silent as a new-born babe in feeding. What teacher can show the source of wisdom? It
is because I know without learning; I know the source and can convey lessons without teaching.
Knowledge is but the excrement of experience: experience its own repetition. The true teacher
implants no knowledge but shows him his own superabundance. Keeping his vision clear he directs
or leads him as a child to the essential. Having shown him the source of wisdom, he retires before
gratitude or sentiment sets in, leaving him to fertilize as he wishes. Is not this the way of Heaven? He
who trusts to his natural fund of genius, has no knowledge of its extent and accomplishes with ease,
but directly he doubts, ignorance obsesses him. Doubt fertilizes in the virgin soil. He is no longer
fearless but a coward to difficulties, his very learning is fear. The difference between genius and
ignorance is a degree of fear. The beginning of wisdom is fear of forethought the reception of

knowledge in learning. Children doubt, and abhor learning. Why, even the affection of courage
results in cleverness! The difference between good and evil is a matter of profundity. Which is nearer
you, self-love and its immorality or love and morals? Not conscious of desert the compeer of Heaven,
and constant happiness in wisdom is the capacity of direction. From self-glorification, from selfexaltation
we rise superior to the incapacity of disquieting fear: the ridiculer to destruction of
humility in repentance. This "self-love" that does not give but is glad to receive is the genuine
opportunity for freedom from covetousness, from the militant amusement of Heaven. He who
subordinates animal instincts to reason, quickly loses control. Are not the animals we see in circuses
trained by torture? And do not the animals reared in love, slay their master? The wise embraces and
nourishes all things, but does not act as master. Only when passions are ruled by foreign environment
are they dangers. Control is by leaving things to work out their own salvation- directly we interfere
we become identified with and subject to their desire. When the Ego sees self-love- there is peace it
becomes the seer. Directly we desire, we have lost all; "we are" what we desire, therefore we never
obtain. Desire nothing, and there is nothing that you shall not realise. Desire is for completion, the
inherent emotion that it is "all happiness," all wisdom, in constant harmony. But directly we believe,
we are liars- and become identified with pain, yet pain and pleasure are one and the same. Therefore
believe nothing, and you will have reverted to a simplicity which childhood has not yet attained. The
fool asks how? as we must believe in pleasure and pain. Now if we could suffer them simultaneously
(pain and pleasure) and hold fast to a principle that ascends, that allows the Ego vibration above
them, should we not have reached the ecstasy? Now the belief is the "Ego," yet separates it from
Heaven as your body separates you from another's. . . . . Therefore by retaining the belief in the "not
necessity" (when conceiving), the Ego is free. The emotion of laughter is exhaustion, the early
suffering hence by making this emotion a "mental state" at the time of unity13 he unites pain and
pleasure, suffers them simultaneously and by the "not necessity" of his belief, his conception
transcends this world and reaches the absolute ecstasy. There is no place where pain or death can enter.

- 13: Of Sex, indeed of everything.

The idea of God is the primordial sin, all religions are evil. Self-love is its own law, which may be
broken with impunity, being the only energy that is not servile, serving its ever-ready purpose. Surely
it is all that is left us that has no sin and is free? Verily, it is the only thing we dare be conscious of.
He that truly pleases himself is wihout virtue, and shall satisfy all men. Hate, jealousy, murder, etc.,
are conditions of love, even as virtue, greed, selfishness, suicide, etc., are conditions or not pleasing
ones's self. There is no sin more sickening than love, for it is the very essence of covetousness and the
mother of all sin, hence it has the most devotees. Self-love only is pure and without a congregation.
He that entirely loves himself induces self-love only. In this he is inexorable, but does not offend like
other men. He is akin to the great purpose, his actions explained for him, good seen of his evil,
without knowing, everyone satisfied with his will. Do not Heaven and Earth unite daily in
spontaneous homage to this will of self-love? No man can show greater self-love, than by giving up
all he believes. Why do I value this self-love before all else? Is it not because I may be free to believe
in evil, but have no thought that anything can do me injury? All is self-love, the people of the world,
if they only knew, are its devotees. My new law is the great clue to life. If the world could
understand this, the rotten fabric discarded, they would diligently follow the way in their own hearts,
there would be no further desire for unity. . . . . Try and imagine what that implies.

May the idea of God perish and with it women: have they not both made me appear clownish? 
Let there be no mistake, purity and innocence is simplicity, happiness is wisdom. What is simple has no
duality.

**The Doctrine of Eternal Self-Love.**

Now self-love is explained. It is the completion of belief. The "self" is the "Neither-Neither," nothing
omitted, indissoluble, beyond prepossession; dissociation of conception by its own invincible love is
the only true, safe, and free. The desire, will, and belief ceasing to exist as separate. Attraction,
repulsion, and control self contained, they become the original unity, inert in pleasure. There is no
duality. There is no desire for unity. At that time, it (the dual principle) rests in its unmodified state.
The belief no longer subject to conception by conceiving "self" as such by loving. At other times, it14
creates a centre, becomes its environment, identified with its ramifications, conception created,
subjection to law and the insatiable desire for unity, inasmuch as the duality is unity. Servitude to
law is the hatred of Heaven. Self-love only is the eternal all pleasing, by meditation on this effulgent
self which is mystic joyousness. At that time of bliss, he is punctual to his imagination, in that day
what happiness is his! A lusty innocent, beyond sin, without hurt! Balanced by an emotion, a
refraction of his ecstasy is all that he is conscious of as external.15 His vacuity causes double
refraction, "He," the self-effulgent lightens in the Ego. Beyond law and the guest at the "Feast of the
Supersensualists." 16 He has power over life and death. 17 Save by this, he is not beyond selfreproach,
verily he has loosed all the trouble of the world, the murder from the lightning. Self-love
preventing the mind from concentration, is identity without form, is no thought as such; law and
external influences contained, do not affect. When that giving up all belief, reflects only its meaning,
then is there purity of vision, innocence of touch, ergo, self-love. Verily, verily men are born, suffer
and die through their belief. Ejaculation is death. Self-love is preservation and life.

- 14: It the "Neither-Neither" emanates tetragrammaton of relatives, the sexes of which
are evolved through their cruciform reflection and are elusive to identity. In their
XXXX they produce unity XXXXX XXXXX conception. Ego generating by subdivision
they embrace eternity, in their manifold ramifications is law.
- 15: i.e. his rainbow.
- 16: Chapter on self-attraction omitted.
- 17: This is the test. The one who doubt would naturally submit himself.

Man to invoke pleasure in his choice, subtracts from desire, his desire is partial desire, becomes subduple
(conflict), never is his energy full. Having no true focus, he is deceived in his strength and
attains a pure measure of pleasure from his body. In success how heavy is his sentence! Pleasure
becomes the illusion. Through dire necessity, "his means," he is bound to its cause and effect, and
becomes a holcaust on the pyre of sentiment. This self-love is the only full energy, all else a
wrapping of dissatisfaction, the hypothesis of desires which obscures.
Man in the misery of his illusions and unsatisfied desires, wings his flight to different religions, and
doctrines, seeks redeception, a hypnotic, a palliative from which he suffers fresh miseries in

exhaustion. The terms of the cure are new illusions, greater entanglement, more stagnant
environment.
Having studied all ways and means to pleasure and pondered over them well again and again, this
self-love has been found by me to be the only free, true and full one, nothing more sane, pure, and
complete. There is no deceit: when by this all experience certainly is known, everything sublimely
beautiful and exceedingly amiable: where is the necessity of other means? Like the drink to the
drunkard everything should be sacrificed for it. This Self-love is now declared by me the means of
evolving millions of ideas for pleasure without love, or its synonyms- self-reproach, sickness, old-age,
and death. The Symposium of self and love. O! Wise Man, Please Thyself.
