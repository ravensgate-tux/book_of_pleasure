üá¨üáß The Death Posture

Ideas of Self in conflict cannot be slain, by resistance they are a reality- no Death or cunning has
overcome them but is their reinforcement of energy. The dead are born again and again lie in the
womb of conscience. By allowing maturity is to predicate decay when by non-resistance is
retrogression to early simplicity and the passage to the original and unity without idea. From that idea
is the formula of non-resistance germinating "Does not matter- please yourself."
The conception of "I am not" must of necessity follow the conception of "I am," because of its
grammar, as surely in this world of sorrow night follows day. The recognition of pain as such, implies
the idea of pleasure, and so with all ideas. By this duality, let him remember to laugh at all times,
recognize all things, resist nothing; then there is no conflict, incompatibility or compulsion as such.

**Transgressing Conception by a Lucid Symbolism.**

Man implies Woman, I transcend these by the Hermaphrodite, this again implies a Eunuch6; all these
conditions I transcend by a "Neither" principle, yet although a "Neither" is vague, the fact of
conceiving it proves its palpability, and again implies a different "Neither."7

But the "Neither-Neither" principle of those two, is the state where the mind has passed beyond
conception, it cannot be balanced, since it implies only itself. The "I" principle has reached the "Does
not matter- need not be" state, and is not related to form. Save and beyond it, there is no other,
therefore it alone is complete and eternal. Indestructible, it has power to destroy- therefore it alone is
true freedom and existence. Through it comes immunity from all sorrow, therefore the spirit is
ecstasy. Renouncing everything by the means shown, take shelter in it. Surely it is the abode of Kia?
This having once been (even Symbolically) reached, is our unconditional release from duality and
time- believe this to be true. The belief free from all ideas but pleasure, the Karma through law
(displeasure) speedily exhausts itself. In that moment beyond time, a new law can become incarnate,

without the payment of sorow, every wish gratified, he8 having become the gratifier by his law. The
new law shall be the arcana of the mystic unbalanced "Does not mattter- need not be," there is no
necessitation, "please yourself" is its creed.9
In that day there can be deliberation. Without subjection, what you wish to believe can be true.
"He"10 is pleased by this imitation, the truth revealed to me by all systems of government but is
himself ungoverned; Kia, the supreme bliss. This the glorious Science of pleasing one's self by a new
agreement, the art of Self-love by recognition, the Psychology of ecstasy by non-resistance.

>6: Sex-less.

>7: They being dual have analogy to certain early sex principles in nature. They are carried further in the sacred alphabet, being too abstruse to explain by orthodox words and grammar.

>8: The Ego.

>9: The belief ever striving for denial- fulness by multiplication, is kept free by retention in this.

>10: "He", the Ego, now becomes the "Absolute."

**The Ritual and Doctrine**

Lying on your back lazily, the body expressing the condition of yawning, suspiring while conceiving
by smiling, that is the idea of the posture. Forgetting time with those things which were essentialreflecting
their meaninglessness, the moment is beyond time and its virtue has happened.
Standing on tip-toe, with the arms rigid, bound behind by the hands, clasped and straning the utmost,
the neck streched- breathing deeply and spasmodically, till giddy and sensation comes in gusts, gives
exhaustion and capacity for the former.

Gazing at your reflection till it is blurred and you know not the gazer, close your eyes (this usually
happens involuntarily) and visualize. The light (always an X in curious evolutions) that is seen
should be held on to, never letting go, till the effort is forgotten, this gives a feeling of immensity
(which sees a small form ), whose limit you cannot reach. This should be practised before
experiencing the foregoing. The emotion that is felt is the knowledge which tells you why.


The death posture is its inevitability accelerated, through it we escape our unending delay by
attachment, the Ego is swept up as a leaf in a fierce gale- in the fleetness of the indeterminable, that
which is always about to happen becomes its truth. Things that are self-evident are no longer
obscure, as by his own will he pleases, know this as the negation of all faith by living it, the end of
the duality of the consciousness. Of belief, a positive death state, all else as sleep, a negative state. It
is the dead body of all we believe, and shall awake a dead corpse. The Ego in subjection to law,
seeks inertion in sleep and death. Know the death posture and its reality in annihilation of law- the
ascension from duality. In that day of tearless lamentation the universe shall be reduced to ashes . . . .
but he escapes the judgment! And what of "I," most unfortunate man! In that freedom there is no
necessitation, what dare I say more? Rather would I commit much sin than compromise myself. There
are many preliminary exercises, as innumerable as sins, futile of themselves but designative of the
ultimate means. The death posture in the reduction of all conception (sin) to the "Neither-Neither"
till the desire is contentment by pleasing yourself. By this and by no other are the inertia of belief;
the restoration of the new sexuality and the ever original self-love in freedom are attained. The
primordial vacuity (or belief) is not by the exercise of focussing the mind on a negation of all
conceivable things, the identity of unity and duality, chaos and uniformity, etc., etc., but by doing it
now, not eventually. Percieve, and feel without the necessity of an opposite, but by its relative.
Percieve light without shadow by its own colour as contrast, through evoking the emotion of laughter
at the time of ecstasy in union, and by practice till that emotion is untiring and subtle. The law or
reaction is defeated by inclusion. Were he to enjoy an hundred pleasures at a time, however much his
ecstasy, he does not lose, but great increase takes place. Let him practise it daily, accordingly, till he
arrives at the centre of desire. He has imitated the great purpose. Like this, all emotions should find
equipoise at the time of emanation, till they become one. Thus by hindering belief and semen from
conception, they become simple and cosmic. By its illumination there is nothing that cannot be
explained. Certainly I find satisfaction in ecstasy. I have now told you a secret of great import, it was
known to me in childhood. Even by sedulously striving for a vacuity of belief, one is cosmic enough
to dwell in the innermost of others and enjoy them. Among men few know what they really believe
or desire, let him begin, who would know, by locating his belief till he sees his will. Existing as dual,
they are identical in desire, by their duality there is no control, for will and belief are ever at
variance, and each would shape the other to its ends, in the issue neither wins as the joy is a covert of
sorrow. Let him unite them.
