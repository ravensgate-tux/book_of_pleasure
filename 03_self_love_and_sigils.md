**KIA──超越と可知のあいだに現れるもの。**

名づけられるものではない。にもかかわらず、私はそれを「KIA」と呼ぶ。だがそれを「自分自身」だと名乗ることすら、私は恐れている。概念によって語られるKIAは、あの「永遠のKIA」とは異なる。それは、あらゆる信念を焼き尽くすもの──にもかかわらず、「自己」の原型として立ち上がり、「死すべきもの」の意識に奴隷のようにまとわりつく。私はそれを説明しようと試みるが、書かれたものはたいてい──いや、意図的に──“嘘の書（Book of Lies）”となる。正統ではなく、原初にして逸脱。neither-neither──「在る」でもなく、「無い」でもない。それは飛翔する視線（volant sight）のように、言葉の狭間から、ただ“そこにある”という気配を伝えてくる。言葉でかろうじて語りうるKIAは、「Neither-Neither（いずれでもない）」である。それは、いかなる属性も付け加えられていない〈私〉──全在（すべてに偏在しているという感覚）のなかで立ち上がる意識だ。それは“聖なるアルファベット”によって象徴的に書き記され、私はいまから、それについて綴ろうとしている。KIAの「放射（emanation）」は、それ自体の“強度”であり──だが、そこに「必然性」があるわけではない。それは、常に存在してきた、処女の量（virgin quantum）。その豊かさによって、私たちは「存在」を得たのだ。だが、それが“どこで・なぜ・どのように”関係しているかを、誰が語ることができよう？疑う者は、“時間”という労苦のなかに自らの限界を住まわせてしまう。KIAは何ものにも「関係している」のではなく、すべてを“許容している”にすぎない。それは概念では捉えられない。だが同時に、すべての概念を貫く本質であり、「意味」の中にひそむ歓びとして浸透している。

 Anterior to Heaven and Earth, in its
aspect that transcends these, but not intelligence, it may be regarded as the primordial sexual
principle, the idea of pleasure in self-love. Only he who has attained the death posture can
apprehend this new sexuality, and its almighty love satisfied. He that is ever servile to belief, clogged
by desire, is identified with such and can see but its infinite ramifications in dissatisfaction.4 The
progenitor of itself and all things, but resembling nothing, this sexuality in its early simplicity,
embodies the everlasting. Time has not changed it, hence I call it new. This ancestral sex principle,
and the idea of self, are one and the same, this sameness its exaction and infinite possibilities, the
early duality, the mystery of mysteries, the Sphinx at the gates of all spirituality. All conceivable
ideas begin and end as light in its emotion, the ecstasy which the creation of the idea of self induces.
The idea is unity by the formula of self, its necessary reality as continuity, the question of all things,
all this universe visible and invisible has come out of it. As unity conceived duality, it begot trinity,
begot tetragrammaton. Duality being unity, is time, the complex of conception, the eternal
refluctuation to the primeval reality in freedom-being trinity of dualities, is the six senses, the five
facets of sex-projecting as environment for self-assimilation in denial, as a complete sexuality. Being
tetragrammaton of dualities is twelvefold by arrangement, the human complex, and may be called the
twelve commandments of the believer. It imagines the eternal decimal, its multiplicity embracing
eternity, from which spring the manifold forms, which constitute existence. Vitalized by the breath of
self-love, life is conscious of one. Self being its opposing force, is alternately conflict, harmony, life
and death. These four principles are one and the same-the conception considered as the complete
"self" or consciousness-hence they may be blended into unity and Symbolized. One form made by
two, that is three-fold and having four directions.

Of name it has no name, to designate. I call it Kia I dare not claim it as myself. The Kia which can be
expressed by conceivable ideas, is not the eternal Kia, which burns up all belief but is the archetype
of "self," the slavery of mortality. Endeavouring to describe "it," I write what may be but not usuallycalled
the "book of lies". 3 The unorthodox of the originable-a volant "sight," that conveys somehow
by the incidental, that truth is somewhere. The Kia which can be vaguely expressed in words is the
"Neither-Neither," the unmodified "I" in the sensation of omnipresence, the illumination symbolically
transcribed in the sacred alphabet, and of which I am about to write. Its emanation is its own
intensity, but not necessariness, it has and ever will exist, the virgin quantum-by its exuberance we
have gained existence. Who dare say where, why and how it is related? By the labour of time the
doubter inhabits his limit. Not related to, but permitting all things, it eludes conception, yet is the
quintessence of conception as permeating pleasure in meaning. Anterior to Heaven and Earth, in its
aspect that transcends these, but not intelligence, it may be regarded as the primordial sexual
principle, the idea of pleasure in self-love. Only he who has attained the death posture can
apprehend this new sexuality, and its almighty love satisfied. He that is ever servile to belief, clogged

- 3: About this "Self"; all conception is the dual principle, the law which is its
conception.
- 4: The unmodified sex principle refracted through the dual principle emanates the
infinite variety of emotions or sexualities, which may be called its ramifications.

**The Transcendental Law, the Law and Testament of the "New."**

The law of Kia is its own arbiter, beyond necessitation, who can grasp the nameless Kia? Obvious but
unintelligible, without form, its design most excellent. Its wish is its superabundance, who can assert
its mysterious purpose? By our knowledge it becomes more obscure, more remote, and our faithopacity.
Without attribute, I know not its name. How free it is, it has no need of sovereignty!
(Kingdoms are their own despoilers.) Without lineage, who dare claim relationship? Without virtue,
how pleasing in its moral self-love! How mighty is it, in its assertion of "Need not be-Does not
matter"! Self-love in complete perspective, serves its own invincible purpose of ecstasy. Supreme
bliss simulating opposition is its balance. It suffers no hurt, neither does it labour. Is it not selfattracting
and independent? Assuredly we cannot call it balance. Could we but imitate its law, all
creation without command would unite and serve our purpose in pleasure and harmony. Kia
transcending conception, is unchanging and inexhaustible, there is no need of illumination to see it. If
we open our mouths to speak of it, it is not of it but of our duality, mighty though it be in its early
simplicity! Kia without conceiving, produces its rendezvous as the fulness of creation. Without
assertion the mightiest energy, without smallness it may appear the least among things. Its possession
ours without asking, its being free, the only thing that is free. Without distinction, it has no favourites,
but nourishes itself. In fear all creation pays homage-but does not extol its moral, so everything
perishes unbeautifully. We endow ourselves with the power we concieve of it, and it acts as master-5,
never the cause of emancipation. Thus for ever from "self" do I fashion the Kia, without likeness, but
which may be regarded as the truth. From this consultation is the bondage made, not by intelligence
shall we be free. The law of Kia is its ever original purpose, undetermined, without change the
emanations, through our conception they materialize and are of that duality, man takes this law from
this refraction, his ideas-reality. With what does he balance his ecstasy? Measure for measure by
intense pain, sorrow, and miseries. With what his rebellion? Of necessity slavery! Duality is the law,
realization by suffering, relates and opposes by units of time. Ecstasy for any length of time is
difficult to obtain, and laboured heavily for. Various degrees of misery alternating with gusts of
pleasure and emotions less anxious, would seem the condition of consciousness and existence.
Duality in some form or another is consciousness as existence. It is the illusion of time, size, entity,
etc.-the world's limit. The dual principle is the quintessence of all experience, no ramification has
enlarged its early simplicity, but is only its repetition, modification or complexity, never is its
evolution complete. It cannot go further than the experience of self-so returns and unites again and
again, ever an anti-climax. For ever retrogressing to its original simplicity by infinite complication is
its evolution. No man shall understand "Why" by its workings. Know it as the illusion that embraces
the learning of all existence. The most aged one who grows no wiser, it may be regarded as the
mother of all things. Therefore believe all experience to be illusion, and the law of duality. As space
pervades an object both in and out, similarly within and beyond this ever-changing cosmos, there is
this secondless principle.

- 5: By scores of incarnations, our eventual "self" is derived from the attributes with
which we endow our God, the abstract Ego or conceptive principle. All conception is
a denial of the Kia, hence we are its opposition, our own evil. The offspring of
ourselves, we are the conflict of what we deny and assert of the Kia. It would seem as though
we cannot be too careful in our choice, for it determines the body we inhabit.
