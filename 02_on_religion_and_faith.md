🇯🇵 Different Religions and Doctrines as Means to Pleasure, Freedom and Power.

What is there to believe, but in Self? And Self is the negation of completeness as reality. No man has
seen self at any time. We are what we believe and what it implies by a process of time in the
conception; creation is caused by this bondage to formula.
Actions are the expressions of ideas bound up in the belief; they being inherent are obscure, their
operation indirect, easily they deceive introspection. Fruits of action are two-fold, Heaven or Hell,
their Unity or Nothingness (Purgatory or Indifference). In Heaven there is desire for Women. Hell the
desire intense. Purgatory is expectation delayed. Indifference but disappointment till recovery. Then
verily they are one and the same. The wise pleasure seeker, having realised they are "different degrees
of desire" and never desirable, gives up both Virtue and Vice and becomes a Kiaist. Riding the Shark
of his desire he crosses the ocean of the dual principle and engages himself in self-love.
Religions are the projection of incapacity, the imaginations of fear, the veneer of superstition, that
paradox is truth, 0 while ofttimes the ornamentation of imbecility. As a virtue in the Idea to maximize
pleasure cheaply, remit your sins and excuse them-is but ceremonial, the expression of puppetry to
the governing fear. Yes! What you have ordained in your religiousness, is your very rack, imagined
though it be! The prospect is not pleasant; you have taught yourself! It has become inborn and your
body is sensitive.

>0: That God is always in Heaven or that the Almighty inconceivable emanates its
conception or negation-commits suicide, etc.

Some praise the idea of Faith. To believe that they are Gods (or anything else) would make them
such-proving by all they do, to be full of its non-belief. Better is it to admit incapacity or
insignificance, than reinforce it by faith; since the superficial "protects" but does not change the vital.
Therefore reject the former for the latter. Their formula is deception and they are deceived, the
negation of their purpose. Faith is denial, or the metaphor Idiotcy, hence it always fails. To make
their bondage more secure Governments force religion down the throats of their slaves, and it always
suceeds; those who escape it are but few, therefore their honour is the greater. When faith perishes,
the "Self" shall come into its own. Others less foolish, obscure the memory that God is a conception
of themselves, and as much subject to law. Then, this ambition of faith, is it so very desirable?
Myself, I have not yet seen a man who is not God already.

Others again, and those who have much knowledge, cannot tell you exactly what "belief" is, or how
to believe in what defies natural laws and existing belief. Surely it is not by saying "I believe"; that art
has long been lost. They are even more subject to bewilderment and distraction directly they open
their mouths full of argument; without power and unhappy unless spreading their own confusion, to
gain cogency they must adopt dogma and mannerism that excludes possibility . . . . . . By the
illumination of their knowledge they deteriorate in accomplishment. Have we not watched them
decay in ration to their expoundings? Verily, man cannot believe by faith or gain, neither can he
explain his knowledge unless born of a new law. We being everything, wherefore the necessity of
imagining we are not?

**Be ye mystic.**

Others believe in prayer . . . . have not all yet learnt, that to ask it to be denied? Let it be the root of
your Gospel. Oh, ye who are living other peoples lives! Unless desire is subconscious, it is not
fulfilled, no, not in this life. Then verily sleep is better than prayer. Quiescence is hidden desire, a
form of "not asking"; by it the female obtains much from man. Utilize prayer (if you must pray) as a
means of exhaustion, and by that you will obtain your desire.
Some do much to show the similarity of different religions; certainly by it I prove the possibility of a
fundamental illusion, but that they never realise-or this Ukase they are the mockery, for how much
they regret! They suffer more conflict than the unenlightened. With what they can identify their own
delusion of fear they call truth. They never see this similarity and the quintessence of religions, their
own poverty of imagination and religion's palliation. Better is it to show the essential difference of
religions. It is as well to know that various means; is not their object to deceive and govern? Surely
then, for the attainment of the transcendental, God and religion should have no place.

Some praise truth so-called, but give it many containers; forgetting its dependence they prove its
relationship and paradox, the song of experience and illusion. Paradox is not "truth", but the truth
that anything can be true for a time. What supersedes paradox and its implicit ("not necessary"), I will
make the foundation of my teaching. Let us determine the deliberative, "the truth" cannot be divided.
Self-love only cannot be denied and is Self-love as such when paradoxical, under any condition,
hence it alone is truth, without accessories complete.

Others praise ceremonial Magic, and are supposed to suffer much Ecstasy! Our asylums are crowded,
the stage is over-run! Is it by symbolizing we become the symbolized? Were I to crown myself King,
should I be King? Rather should I be an object of disgust or pity. These Magicians, whose insincerity
is their safety, are but the unemployed dandies of the Brothels. Magic is but one's natural ability to
attract without asking; ceremony what is unaffected, its doctrine the negation of theirs. I know them
well and their creed of learning that teaches the fear of their own light. Vampires, they are as the very
lice in attraction. Their practices prove their incapacity, they have no magic to intensify the normal,
the joy of a child or healthy person, none to evoke their pleasure or wisdom from themselves. Their
methods depending on a morass of the imagination and a chaos of conditions, their knowledge
obtained with less decency than the hyena his food, I say they are less free and do not obtain the
satisfaction of the meanest among animals. Self condemned in their disgusting fatness, their emptiness
of power, without even the magic of personal charm or beauty, they are offensive in their bad taste
and mongering for advertisement. The freedom of energy is not obtained by its bondage, great power
not by disintegration. Is it not because our energy (or mind stuff) is already over bound and divided,
that we are not capable, let alone magical?

Some believe any and every thing is symbolic, and can be transcribed, and explain the occult, but of
what they do not know. (Great spiritual truths?) So argument a metaphor, cautiously confusing the
obvious which developes the hidden virtue. This unnecessary corpulency, however impressive, is it
not disgusting? (The Elephant is exceeding large but extremely powerful, the swine though odious
does not breed the contempt of our good taste.) If a man is no hero to his servant, much less can he
remain a mystic in the eyes of the curious; similarity educates mimicry. Decorate your meaning,
however objectionable (as fact), after you have shown your honesty. Truth, though simple, never
needs the argument of confusion for obscurity; its own pure symbolism embraces all possibilities as
mystic design. Take your stand in commonsense and you include the truth which cannot lie; no
argument has yet prevailed. Perfect proportion suggest no alteration, and what is useless decays.

They reject all the modern symbolism 1 and reach an absurd limit very early. Not counting on change
2 and (at times) the arbitrary nature of symbolism or the chance of a preserved folly, by their
adoption of the traditional without a Science, as having reading to the present, their symbolism is
chaotic and meaningless. Not knowing the early rendering, they succeed in projecting their own
meagreness by this confusion, as explaining the ancient symbols. Children are more wise. This
conglomeration of antiquity decayed, collected with the disease of greed-is surely the chance for
charity? Forgetting trumpery ideas, learn the best tradition by seeing you own functions and the
modern unbiassed. Some praise the belief in a moral doctrinal code, which they naturally and
continually transgress, and never obtain their purpose. Given the right nature, they succeed fairly in
their own governing, and are those most healthy, sane and self-pleased. It may be called the negation
of my doctrine, they obtain tolerable satisfaction, whereas mine is complete. Let him tarry here, who
is not strong for the great work. In freedom he might be lost. So fledge your wings fearlessly, ye
humble ones!

- 1: All means of locomotion, machinery, governments, institutions, and everything
essentially modern, is vital symbolism of the workings of our mind, etc.

- 2: The symbol of justice known to the Romans is not symbolic of Divine, or our
justice, at least not necessarily or usually. The vitality is not exactly like water-nor
are we trees; more like ourselves, which might incidentally include trees somewhere
unlearnt-much more obvious in our workings at present.

Others say knowledge only is eternal, it is the eternal illusion of learning-the Ukase of learning what
we already know. Directly we ask ourselves "how" we induce stupidity; without this conception what
is there we could not know and accomplish? Others for concentration, it will not free you, the mind
conceiving the law is bondage. Arrived at that, you will want deconcentration. Dissociation from all
ideas but one is not release but imaginative fulfilment, or the fury of creation. Others again, that all
things are emanations of the Divine Spirit, as rays from the Sun, hence the need of emancipation?
Verily, things are of necessity through their conception and belief. Then let us destroy or change
conception, and empty the belief.

These and many other doctrines, are declared by me as the perpetuators of sin and illusion. Each and
all depending on a muddled implication, obscuring, yet evolved from the duality of the consciousness
for their enjoyment. In fear they would vomit hot blood were they to see the fruits of their actions
and pleasures. Thus believing in widely different doctrines, they are of the dual principle, necessary
parasites on each other. Like drugs and the surgeon's knife, they only annul or at best remove an
effect. They do not change or remove the fundamental cause (the law). "Oh, God, thou art the
stagnant environment." All is quackery: these religions whose very existence depend on their failure,
are so full of misery and confusion, have only multiplied arguments, as full of argument as they are
evil, so crowded with non-essentials, being so barren of any free pleasure in this life or another, I
cannot uphold their doctrines. Their criterion for enjoyment-death! Better it were a man renounce
them all, and embrace his own invincible purpose. He cannot go further, and this is his only release.
By it he may put his pleasure where he will, and find satisfaction.
