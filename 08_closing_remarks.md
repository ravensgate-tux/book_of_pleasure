**Ecstasy in Self-love the Obsession**

My dearest, I will now explain the only safe and true formula, the destroyer of the darkness of the
World, the most secret among all secrets. Let it be secret to him who would attain. Let it cover any
period of time, depending on his conception. There is no qualification18, nor ritual or ceremony. His
very existence symbolising all that is necessary to perfection. Most emphatically, there is no need of
repetition or feeble imitation. You are alive!
Magic, the reduction of properties to simplicity, making them transmutable to utilise them afresh by
direction, without capitalization, bearing fruit many times. Know deliberation, over consciousness
and concentration to be its resistance and sycophancy, the ultimate acquirement of idiotcy. Whether
for his own pleasure or power, the fulfilment of desire is his purpose, he would terminate this by
magic. Let him wait for a desire analogous in intensity 19, he then sacrifices this desire (or its
fulfilment) to the initial desire, by this it becomes organic, the quantum. He has not attained freedom
from law 20. Hence let him wait for a belief to be subtracted, that period when disillusionment has
taken place 21. Verily disappointment is his chance. "This free entity of belief" and his desire are
united to his purpose by the use of Sigils or sacred letters. By projecting the consciousness into one
part, sensation not being manifold, becomes intensified. By the abstention of desire, except in the
object, this is attained (at the psychological time this determines itself).
By non-resistance (involuntary thought and action), worry and apprehension of non-fulfilment, being
transient, find no permanent abode: he desires everything. Anxiety defeats the purpose, it retains and
exposes the desire. Conscious desire is non-attractive. The mind quiet and focussed, undisturbed by
external images does not distort the sense impressions (there is no hallucination; it would end in
imaginative fulfilment), but magnifies the existing desire, and joins it to the object in secret.

- 18: The means being simpicity, he is comparitively free to make his own
qualifications and difficulties, i.e., many retirements are absurd and at once prove
his incapacity, the non existence of what he sets about to prove. He at once sets his
limit and servility.
- 19: Just a natural desire.

- 20: This is a short formula for those whose belief is full in the law, are house holders
following their desires. The formula holds good for any purpose.
- 21: Illustration, the loss of faith in a friend, or an union that did not fulfill
expectations.

**Casting the Shadow.**

The Ego not being totally oblivious, let him retain only and visualise the Sigil form, it is his chalice,
the means of vacuity and incarnation. By the deliberation of an analogous emotion at that time, he
deputises the law (reaction). Miraculous is he, balance not known in this world imitated (attained).
All other consciousness annulled with safety, the vehicle strong enough for the ecstasy, he is beyond
hurt. Now let him imagine an union takes place between himself (the mystic union of the Ego and
Absolute). The nectar emitted, let him drink slowly, again and again22. After this astonishing
experience his passion is incomparable, there is nothing in the world he will desire: unless he wills.
That is why people do not understand me. The ecstasy in its emotion is omnigenous. Know it as the
nectar of life, the Syllubub of Sun and Moon. Verily he steals the fire from Heaven: the greatest act
of bravery in the world. Deliberation egotized, except in the refraction 23 of the ecstasy, is exposure
and death, becoming a presiding obsession, control having been given to a prior experience and is
over-conscious of that through it momentarily finding freedom from its native law; thus generating
double personality (Insanity).

- 22: If it becomes physical, let him imagine another's body, he has that sigil or its
emergency. This, although not his original purpose, he will and exceedingly amiable.
- 23: Laughter in this case.

By these means there is no desire beyond fulfilment, no accomplishment too wonderful, depending
on the amount of free belief 24.

- 24: It may be done by localizing desire to one sense, hence by this formula using the
ear as the vehicle, one hears the most transcendental music ever conceived, being the
voices and harmony of every conceivable animal and human existence and so with
each sense.

Men of small pleasure and enterprise, oblivious of your purpose, fault-finding, avaricious, sinful, who
cannot live without women or enjoy without pain, fearsome, inconstant, diseased, and withered,
dependent, cruel, deceived, and liars, the worst of men! Know, Oh, Lord, Oh beloved Self, I have
now told you of that most secret tavern where passion goes when youth has gone, where any man
may drink of the nectar of all-beneficent and gratuitous ecstasy. The most pleasurable nourishment
that harms no one.

**Note on the Difference of Magical Obsession (Genius) and Insanity.**

MAGICAL obsession is that state when the mind is illuminated by sub-conscious activity evoked
voluntarily by formula at our own time, etc., for inspiration. It is the condition of Genius.

Other obsession is the "blind leading the blind," caused by quietism, known as mediumism, an
opening out of the Ego to (what is called) any external influence, elementals, or disembodied energy.
A transmutated consciousness that is a resistance to "true" sub-conscious activity, it being a voluntary
insanity, a somnambulation of the Ego with "no form" or control to guide it: hence its emanations are
stupid in suggestion, or memories of childhood.

Obsession known as or related to insanity is an experience that is dissociated from the personality
(Ego) through some sort of rejection. It is sub-crystalline, and cannot become permanently attached
to the sub-consciousness, not having exhausted or completed itself by realisation. Depending on its
degree of intensity and resistance shown at some time or another, the Ego has or has not knowledge
of the obsession; always is its expression autonomous, divorced from personal control, power of
direction and timing. Concentration determines dissociation. Enthusiasm for one object seeking
completion by identification, sacrifices all else, or deliberately forgets. Its separation from the Ego (it
becoming equal, or more in bulk than the rest of the consciousness, causes subdivision or "double
personality"), is caused by its own intensity or by shock of resistance determined by some
incompatibility of the desired or desire.

Concentration is dissatisfied desire, a conflict that can never be satisfied, because of its means. When
the Ego, not appearing to have or not knowing the means of fulfilment, seeks its repudiation,
repression, imaginative fulfilment, or transmutation to escape its worry. None of these is the desire's
or obsession's annihilation, but its separation or concealment from the rest of the Ego, its premature
sub-conscious existence. It is held there only when some form of resistance is active, when resistance
is dormant- control is given to the presiding obsession, allowing its incarnation in, and swamping of
the Ego, which has to live and perform its emotional experience. Disease and Insanity (all disease is
insanity) is caused when the disembodied energy has no vital function. It is this energy which is
utilised for the vitalization of Sigils.

**Sigils.**

**The Psychology of Believing.**

ascertained, the study of knowledge is unproductive. Even if "they" were known their study is
useless. We are not the object by the perception, but by becoming it. Closing the gateways of sense is
no help. Verily I will make common-sense the foundation of my teaching. Otherwise, how can I
convey my meaning to the deaf, vision to the blind, and my emotion to the dead? In a labyrinth of
metaphor and words, intuition is lost, therefore without their effort must be learned the truth about
one's self from him who alone knows the truth . . . . yourself.

Of what use the wisdom of Virginity to him who has been raped by the seducer, ignorance? Of what
use sciences or any knowledge except as medicine? Hidden treasure does not come at the word nor
by digging with your hands in the main road. Even with the proper implements and accurate
knowledge of place, etc., may be but the acquisition of what you possessed long ago. There is a great
doubt as to whether it is hidden, except by the strata of your experience and atmospheres of your belief.

The pertinent question now proposed by "Thee" should be asked by those desirous of some measure
of genius. My answer like the mighty germ is in agreement with the universe, simple and full of deep
import and for a time extremely objectionable to your ideas of good and beauty. Listen, attentively,
O! Aspirant, all agog for information, to my answer, for by living the meaning thou shalt truly be
freed from the bondage of constitutional ignorance. Thou must live it thyself; I cannot live it for thee.

The chief cause of genius is realization or "I" by an emotion that allows the lightning assimilation of
what is perceived. This emotion is immoral in that it allows free association of knowledge without the
accessories of belief. Its condition is, therefore, ignorance of "I am" and "I am not" with absentmindedness
as believing. Its most excellent state is the "Neither-Neither," the free or atmospheric "I."

You remember in your youth the thought "that this world is a curious place" in the emotion when
you felt "why" as to whether this life is a reasonable development? What was the cause of this and of
your summarily dismissing it from your mind? Again the feeling that the most commonplace object is
magnificently strange and the vague emotion of co-relation between the incompatible (exhaustive
arguments often see this, but always excuse it); the curiosity and shock with a more intimate
association with the wonders of creation. What is it that prevents you following investigation into
"what exactly is surprise," etc.? What is the cause of your believing more in God than a dog-fight?
Yet you fear dogs more than God! Where is the difference between yourself choked with disquieting
piety, and the innocence of a babe? Perhaps in these is the cause of ignorance.

Belief is the fall from the Absolute. What are you going to believe? Truth seeks its own negation.
Different aspects are not the truth, nor are they necessary to truth. Of its emanations which are you to
strangle at birth? Are you illegitimate? You believe in right and wrong- what punishment will you
determine? Can you escape the driving "Must"? Who can escape boredom- without change? Who
remain single and content! What man among you is large and free enough to encompass his "self"?
Your belief obfuscates lineage. Ambition is smallness- your customed environment. Remember, time
is an unstudied imagination of the experienced. What may be called the early experience was its
completion, so of learning there is no finis. What you learn to-morrow is determined by what you
have done- the accomplished lesson of yesterday. Never learning to-day what you can do to-morrow
is called loss, but is theft from time, wholesomeness and rejuvenescence. Repeat this delay again and
again till you arrive at spontaneity, chance in safety. The pursuit of learning (believing) is the
grotesque incubator of stupidity.

If you could truly believe, we should realise the virtue of it. We are not free to believe . . . . however
much we so desire, having conflicting ideas to first exhaust. Sigils are the art of believing; my
invention for making belief organic, ergo, true belief.

When by the wish to believe- it is of the necessity incompatible with an existing belief and is not
realized through the inhibition of the organic belief- the negation of the wish, faith moves no
mountains, not till it has removed itself. Supposing I wish to be great (is not counting that I am), to
have "faith" and believe that I am, does not make me great- even were I to keep up the pretence to the
end . . . . it being ceremonial insincerity, the affirmation of my incapacity. I am incapable, because
that is the true belief, and organic. To believe differently is but affectation. Therefore the imagination
or "faith" that I am great, is a superficial belief. The reaction and denial, caused by the troublesome
effervescence of the organic incapacity. Denial or faith does not change or annihilate it, but is its
reinforcement and preservation. Therefore belief, to be true, must be organic and sub-conscious. The
desire to be great can only become organic at a time of vacuity, and by giving it (Sigil) form. When
conscious of the Sigil form (any time but the Magical) it should be repressed, a deliberate striving to
forget it, by this it is active and dominates at the unconscious period, its form nourishes and allows it
to become attached to the sub-consciousness and become organic, that accomplished, is its reality
and realization. He becomes his concept of greatness.

So belief becomes true and vital by striving against it in consciousness and by giving it form. Not by
the striving of faith. Belief exhausts itself by confession and non-resistance, i.e., consciousness.
Believe not to believe, and in degree you will obtain its existence. Timeliness depending on your
morality, give to the poor. If the ambitious only knew it is as difficult to become incapable as it is to
become great. They are mutual as accomplishments and equally satisfying.

**The Sub-Consciousness.**

ALL geniuses have active sub-consciousness, and the less they are aware of the fact, the greater their
accomplishments. The sub-consciousness is exploited by desire reaching it. So consciousness should
not contain the "great" desire once the Ego has wished: and should be filled with an affected
ambition for something different, not vice-versa, the inevitable penalty of cowardice lurking
somewhere: surely not an inglorious deceit? Genius, like heroism, is a matter of bravery- you have to
forget fear, or incapacity somehow . . . . hence its expression is always spontaneous. How simple it is
to acquire genius- you know the means; who will take the plunge? The learning of "How" is the
eternal "Why"- unanswered! A genius is such, because he does not know how or why.

**The Storehouse of Memories with an Ever-Open Door.**

Know the sub-consciousness to be an epitome of all experience and wisdom, past incarnations as
men, animals, birds, vegetable life, etc., etc., everything that exists, has and ever will exist. Each
being a stratum in the order of evolution. Naturally then, the lower we probe into these strata, the
earlier will be the forms of life we arrive at; the last is the Almighty Simplicity. And if we succeed in
awakening them, we shall gain their properties, and our accomplishment will correspond. They being
experiences long passed, must be evoked by extremely vague suggestion, which can only operate
when the mind is unusually quiet or simple. To have their wisdom does not mean the necessity of
their bodies- the body modifies in relation to "means" (we travel faster than the hunting leopard, but
do not have its body), when it is the means it changes accordingly. Now, if we observe Nature, the
early forms of life are wonderful in their properties, adaptablility, etc; their strength enormous, and
some are indestructible. No matter what the desire is, it always is its accomplishment. A microbe has
the power to destroy the world (and certainly would if it took an interest in us). If you were to
dismember its limb, the mutilated part would regrow, etc. So by evoking and becoming obsessed or
illuminated by these existences, we gain their magical properties, or the knowledge of their
attainment. This is what already happens (everything happens at all times) though exceedingly
slowly; in striving for knowledge we repel it, the mind works best on a simple diet.

**The Key to Prophecy.**

The law of Evolution is retrogression of function governing progression of attainment, i.e., the more
determined by that desire causing the activity of our bird etc. Karmas. Directly our desire reaches the
stratum belonginging to those existences that can "fly" without wings- so shall we fly without
machines. This sub-conscious activity is the "capacity," the "knowledge"; all other we acquire is of a
negative or manurial value. The virtue of learning and acquiring knowledge by the ordinary means is
in its worry and disappointment, of that degree which causes exhaustion: by that the desire might
accidentally reach the real abode of knowledge, i.e., the sub-consciousness. Inspiration is always at a
void moment, and most great discoveries accidental, usually brought about by exhaustion of the
mind. My formula and Sigils for sub-conscious activity are the means of inspiration, capacity or
genius, and the means of accelerating evolution. An economy of energy and method of learning by
enjoyment. A bat first grew wings and of the proper kind, by its desire being organic enough to reach
the sub-consciousness. If its desire to fly had been conscious, it would have had to wait till it could
have done so by the same means as ourselves, i.e., by machinery. All genius has an hypothesis
(usually natural) in the form of a hobby, which serves to restrain and occupy the conscious mind, to
prevent its interference with spontaneous expression. The great Leonardo's mathematics, etc., served
to "Deceive" him as such an hypothesis (and as Sigils). Our lives are full of the Symbolism of those
predominating Karmas we are governed by. All ornament, useless dress, etc., are such (they please
people because they feel the identification), and the means of locating them (Karmas). The
symbolism of crowning a man King, is that he, resembling God (on earth), has reached the lowest
strata of his sub-consciousness (those one-cell organisms if you like), which predominate as
governing his functions. (Of course, those crowned Kings are never such, they symbolise the "hope,"
not the reality.) Hence the floral nature of and precious stones in design of the crown relate to first
principles. He is King who has reached the dual principle in its simplicity, the first experience which
is all experience . . . . he has no need of crowns and kingdoms.

By Sigils and the acquirement of vacuity, any past incarnation, experience, etc., can be summoned to
consciousness. It may even happen in sleep in the form of dreams, but this means is very difficult.
(Chapters on day and night dreaming for pleasure omitted.)

Total vacuity is difficult and unsafe for those governed by morality, complexes, i.e., whose belief is
not entirely self-love. Hence this desideratum of Sigils, etc.

Know all ritual, ceremony, conditions, as arbitrary (you have yourself to please), a hindrance and
confusion; their origin was for amusement, later for the purpose of deceiving other from knowing the
truth and inducing ignorance; and as always happens their high priests were the more deceived
themselves. He who deceives another deceives himself much more. Therefore know the Charlatans by
their love of rich robes, ceremony, ritual, magical retirements, absurd conditions, and other stupidity,
too numerous to relate. Their entire doctrine a boastful display, a cowardice hungering for notoriety;
their standard everything unnecessary, their certain failure assured. Hence it is that those with some
natural ability quickly lose it by their teaching. They can only dogmatise, implant and multiply that
which is entirely superficial. Were I a teacher I should not act as master, as knowing more, the pupil
could lay no claim to discipleship. Assimilating slowly, he would not be conscious of his learning, he
would not repeat the vital mistake; without fear he would accomplish with ease. The only teaching
possible is to show a man how to learn from his own wisdom, and to utilise his ignorance and
mistakes. Not by obscuring his vision and intention by righteousness.

**Sigils. Belief with Protection.**

**Magickal Obsession.*:

I will now explain their creation and use; there is no difficulty about it, how pure and clear it all is 25.
Out of love for my foolish devotees I invented it. All desire, whether for Pleasure, Knowledge, or
Power, that cannot find "Natural" expression, can by Sigils and their formula find fulfilment from the
sub-consciousness. Sigils are the means of guiding and uniting the partially free belief26 with an
organic desire, its carriage and retention till its purpose served in the sub-conscious self, and its means
of reincarnation in the Ego. All thought can be expressed by form in true relation. Sigils are
monograms of thought, for the government of energy (all heraldry, crests, monograms, are Sigils and
the Karmas they govern), relating to Karma; a mathematical means of symbolising desire and giving it
form that has the virtue of preventing any thought and association on that particular desire (at the
magical time), escaping the detection of the Ego, so that it does not restrain or attach such desire to its
own transitory images, memories and worries, but allows it free passage to the sub-consciousness.

- 25: By this system, you know exactly what (you believe) your Sigil must relate to. If you
used any form stupidly, you might possibly "conjure up" exactly what you did not
want- the mother of insanity, or what always happens then, nothing at all. This being
the only system, any result other than by it is accidental. Also you do not have to dress
up as a traditional magician, wizard or priest, build expensive temples, obtain virgin
parchment, black goat's blood, etc., etc., in fact no theatricals or humbug.
- 26: Free belief or energy, i.e., a disappointed desire, not yet an obsession.

Sigils are made by combining the letters of the alphabet simplified. Illustration27, the word "Woman"
in Sigil form is (example) or (example) or (example) etc. The word tiger (example) or (example) etc.,
etc. The idea being to obtain a simple form which can be easily visualised at will, and has not too
much pictorial relation to the desire. The true method has a much greater virtue, which cannot be
explained briefly, being the secret of thought form, as degrees of suggestion, and what exactly is in a
name. We have now agreed as to how a Sigil is made, and what virtue it has. Verily, what a person
believes by Sigils, is the truth, and is always fulfilled. This system of Sigils is believed by taking it up
as a hobby at a time of great disappointment or sorrow. By Sigils I have endowed fools with wisdom,
made the wise fools, giving health to the sick and weak, disease to the strong, etc. Now, if for some
purpose, you wanted the strength of a tiger- you would make a sentence such as:- "This my wish to
obtain the strength of a tiger." (Message from person who typed up this file: In constructing the
sentence of desire, beginning with "This my will," has been said by some to be more efficacious.)
Sigilized this would be:-

This my wish (illustrative example of this part of the sentence)

To obtain (ditto)

The strength of a Tiger (same as said above)

Combined as one Sigil (example) or (more simplified example).

- 27: There are six methods of Sigils employed in this book, each corresponding to
different strata. The one shown here is illustrative and the fundamental idea of them
all, from which anyone can evolve his own system. Conditions, etc., or necessity
subsequently evolve themselves. Also a person has more power of creation and
originality with a limited means of expression.

Now by virtue of this Sigil you are able to send your desire into the subconsciousness (which
contains all strength); that having happened, it is the desire's realization by the manifestation of the
knowledge or power necessary.

First, all consciousness except of the Sigil has to be annulled; do not confuse this with
concentration- you simply conceive the Sigil any moment you begin to think. Vacuity 28 is obtained
by exhausting the mind and body by some means or another. A personal or traditional means serves
equally well, depending on temperament; choose the most pleasant; these should be held in favour,
Mantras and Posture, Women and Wine, Tennis, and the playing of Patience, or by walking and
concentration on the Sigil, etc., etc. None is necessary to him who has (even symbolically) for a
moment by the "Neither-Neither" conquered the dual principle (Conception), his Ego is free from
gravity. If the Sigil is made an obsession by continual apprehension, its realization may happen at any
moment, in the form of inspiration. This is done by reverting the mind to the Sigil when one is
extremely worried- the time of exhaustion is the time of fulfilment. At the time of exhaustion or
vacuity, retain only and visualize the Sigil form- eventually it becomes vague, then vanishes and
success is assured. by the Ego conceiving only the Sigil, and not being able to conceive anything from
it, all energy is focussed through it, the desire for identification carries it to the corresponding subconscious
stratum, its destination. The Sigil being a vehicle, serves the purpose of protecting
consciousness from the direct manifestation of the (consciously unacknowledged) obsession, conflict
is avoided with any incompatible ideas and neither gains separate personality. It (the obsession) is
either gradually assimilated and becomes organic or returns to its original abode, its purpose of
illumination served. Hence the mind, by Sigils, depending upon the intensity of desire, is illuminated
or obsessed (knowledge or power) from that particular Karma (the sub-conscious stratum, a
particular existence and knowledge gained by it) relative to the desire, but not from memory or
experience which was recent. Knowledge is obtained by the sensation, resulting from the unity of the
desire and Karma. Power, by its "actual" vitalization and resurrection.

- 28: This is not the passivity of mediumism which opens the mind to what is called
external influence- disembodied energy usually having no better purpose than to raptables.
There are many means of attaining this state of vacuity: I mention the most
simple, there is no need for crucifixion. Drugs are useless. Smoking and laziness the
more difficult.

This knowledge leaves its stratum in company with the energy or desire returning to the Ego. It
escapes the Ego's resistance by associating with similar images, memories, or experiences relative
(recieved in this life), that the mind contains, and crystalizes itself by their symbolism. Hence most
illumination is symbolic, and must be subsequently translated.

**On Myself.**

Conceiving, thou hast given no sign of life. In claiming thee, a labour of creating value, is nothing
worth holding, nothing satisfying; the realization of thy inhibition all? By self-effacement would
seem reality. This self, how empty! how prolific of incompleteness! In self-denial its stimulation to
simulate reality . . . . more and more comes out- these ugly mists of illusion are parental, the cause of
Heaven's hatred! That is why I fear to believe in God, subordination to an attribute, an idea of Self is
not freedom of love! Probably Almighty is he who is unconscious of the idea of God. Now may the
fierceness of my unity be "Thy" silence and for me no longer a query or labour to espouse my doubt.
Yet mankind for ever doubts, quirks, and for every pleasure pays, till he becomes millionary: the
punishment shall fit the appraisement of his capitalization, there is that fear! The rich in dross, to
cheat his conscience, affects humility, speaks of himself as "poor," his possessions as "burdens," or of
"small account"! Of what consolation the truth in the day of weary waiting and watching, the restless
striving, the imprisonment, the rack, the horrors of every conceivable torture? When he becomes
accustomed, loses reality, and no longer deterred, will he then create God and miseries afresh? Oh,
folly of the world, deny thy faith, renounce this Bloody-Sceptred God and confess. The completion
of folly is the beginning of childhood, but of knowledge there is no end. It was the straying that
found the path direct. From childhood, I have never denied my invincible purpose. Oh, silent
watcher, thou sleepless eye of the Universe, watch over the beginning of all my ideas. The misery of
the world would seem eternal, whilst I, in the midst, like an infant not yet smiling, am impervious in
purity (of self-love) but I dare not claim its service! I am in eternal want of realization, poor though I
be, my contentment is beyond your understanding. An opinionist, I fear to advocate an argument, or
compromise myself by believing my own doctrines as such . . . .may they ever be their own
expurgers! Fearsome of knowledge, may my belief be its emptiness, yea, ignorance! From my daring
to believe religions, doctrines, creeds, so shall I hold the jewel of truth. So cautios am I,
simultaneously do I deny that which I affirm, and hold fast to the "not-necessity," by paradox
superseded, without antecedent, spontaneous, I revert to the Absolute, watch my intoxication and
control- the reaction of Karma. How easy is the Way, it would seem as though nothing should be said
but all unsaid! May my words be few and pregnant! Alas, the futility of the idea of God has not yet
reached its limit, all men liars, appear striving for insanity as its climax: while I alone as one
prematurely aged, reason tottering on its throne, remain sane, in positive chastity, confessing no
conscience, no morals- a virgin in singleness of purpose.
