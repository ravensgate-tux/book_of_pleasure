🇯🇵 魔術の儀式と教義──完全版

**自己愛における法悦──執着という現象**

最愛なる者よ、私はいまこそ、この世の闇を打ち砕く唯一の安全で真実なる秘法を明かそう。すべての秘密の中で最も奥深く、成就を望む者にのみ秘されたままにしておくべきものである。この実践は、実際にかける時間はその人の「理解の深さ」によって異なるが──資格も儀式も不要である。彼の存在そのものが、すでに完全性に必要なすべてを象徴している。したがって、繰り返しや形だけの模倣に意味はない。あなたは、すでに生きているのだから。

魔術とは、属性を単純化し、変換可能な状態に還元すること──再利用可能なものとして、方向性を与え、資本化することなく、何度も実を結ばせる技術である。意識的に考えすぎたり、集中しすぎることは、魔術にとってはむしろ抵抗であり、へつらいであり、最終的には「知的愚かさ」に至る。彼が「快楽」や「力」のいずれかのために欲望を成就しようとするならば、それは魔術によって終息させねばならない。そこで、彼は同等の強度をもつ欲望が現れるのを待ち、その欲望（またはその成就）を最初の欲望に捧げることによって、量子的で有機的な連結を果たす。この時点では、彼はまだ「法（law）」から自由ではない。

したがって、幻滅が訪れた時──信念が脱落するその瞬間を待たねばならない。まさにその「失望」が、彼にとってのチャンスである。この「自由となった信念」と欲望は、シジル（聖なる文字）を通じて目的に結びつけられる。意識をひとつの部位に集中させることで、感覚が分散されず、強くなる。欲望をその対象以外には向けずに保留することで、それは心理的なタイミングで自己決定的に達成される。非抵抗（意図しない思考と行動）の姿勢をとることで、心配や成就しないことへの不安は一過性のものとなり、彼の内には定着しない──なぜなら彼はあらゆるものを欲する者となるからである。

欲望への「不安」は目的を妨げ、それを露出・固定させてしまう。意識的な欲望は魅力を持たない。心が静かで集中しており、外的イメージによって乱されていないならば、感覚の印象を歪めることはなく（つまり幻覚に陥らず）、すでに存在する欲望が増幅され、対象と密やかに結びつくのだ。

>18: 「資格（qualification）」の不要性について
>　魔術の手段が「単純性（simplicity）」である限り、実践者は自分で条件や制限を設定する自由をある程度持っている。しかし、それによって「過剰な制限」や「引きこもりの儀式」を課すならば、それは彼自身の無能を証明し、目的の空虚さを露呈するものとなる。
>　Spareは「儀式的な撤退」や「禁欲的自己試練」などを嘲笑している。
>
>19: 「欲望の強度が等しいもの」とは？
>　特別な条件を必要としない、**ごく自然な欲求（just a natural desire）**のこと。
　ここで重要なのは、抑圧されていない素直な欲望がエネルギーの源となるという点。
>
>20: 「法（Law）」に信を置く者への短縮式
　この簡易式（desireとbeliefの結合によるシジル化）は、欲望に従って日常を送る家庭人や信仰のある者にとって有効であるとされる。Spareは一貫して「実践」の重要性を説くが、日常生活におけるそれも排除しない。
>
>21: 「幻滅の瞬間」の例
　たとえば「友人への信頼を失ったとき」や、「愛による結びつきが期待を裏切ったとき」などがそれにあたる。信念の崩壊＝欲望の開放という視点は、Spareの魔術論の一端をなす。

**内なる影を投影する**

自我（Ego）が完全に忘却されていないときは、ただシジルの形を保持し、視覚化せよ。それは杯（chalice）であり、「空」への到達と具現化の手段である。その瞬間に、同質の感情を意図的に想起することで、彼は法（＝反応）を代行する者となる。このとき、彼はこの世界では知られざる均衡を体現し、他のすべての意識が安全に消去される中で、恍惚のための「器」として十分に強固な存在となる。彼はもはや傷つかない。そして今、彼は次のように想起すべきである──自我と絶対者の神秘的な合一が起きるのだと。そのとき放たれる「蜜（ネクター）」を、ゆっくり、何度も味わえ。この驚異的な体験の後、彼の情熱は他の何者とも比べがたくなり、彼は「望まない限り」何ものも欲することはなくなる──ゆえに、人々は私のことを理解できないのだ。その恍惚の感情は**万象生成の源（omni-generative）**である。これを「生命の蜜」と知れ──太陽と月の交わり（Syllubub）。まことに、彼は天から火を盗んだ──世界で最も勇敢な行為である。ただし、恍惚の屈折（refraction）を除くあらゆる意識的な熟慮（deliberation egotized）は危険である。それは過去の経験に主導権を明け渡し、「一時的な自由」の中に意識が閉じ込められた結果として、二重人格（＝狂気）を生成する。

>22:「蜜（ネクター）」が身体的現象として感じられる場合、そのときは他者の身体を想像せよ──その身体には、彼が創造したシジルが宿っているか、緊急的に投影されたものとみなされる。それがもともとの目的ではなかったとしても、彼はそれを「意志する」ことになる。そしてそれはきわめて愛すべきものとなる（exceedingly amiable）。
>
>23:「恍惚の屈折（refraction）」とは、この文脈においては、笑い（laughter）を指す。つまり恍惚が極まると、言葉を超えた「無意味で深い笑い」が生まれ、これが「分裂を超えて統合へ至る回路」**となる。
>
>24:「自由な信念（free belief）」が多いほど、すべては可能になる。欲望をひとつの感覚に局在化させることで、その感覚器官が**超越的ヴィークル（乗り物）**となる。
たとえば耳を使えば、あらゆる存在（動物・人間など）の声とハーモニーが一体となった「この世で最も超越的な音楽」が聴こえる──他の感覚でも同様の応用が可能である。

快楽も冒険も乏しい小心者たちよ──己の目的すら忘れ、あら探しに明け暮れ、強欲で、罪深く、女なしでは生きられず、苦痛なしでは快楽を感じられない。臆病で、移り気で、病んで、干からび、他者に依存し、残酷で、騙されやすく、そして嘘つき──最も堕落した人間たちよ！だが、聞くがいい。ああ、我が主よ、我が愛しき〈自己〉よ──私はいま、**「あの最も秘密の酒場」**のことを語ったのだ。そこは、情熱が青春の終わりとともに向かう場所。誰であれ、その扉を叩きさえすれば、無償にして万人に恩恵をもたらす恍惚の蜜（ネクター）を味わえる。それは、誰ひとり傷つけることのない、もっとも歓喜に満ちた滋養なのである。

**Note on the Difference of Magical Obsession (Genius) and Insanity.**

MAGICAL obsession is that state when the mind is illuminated by sub-conscious activity evoked
voluntarily by formula at our own time, etc., for inspiration. It is the condition of Genius.

Other obsession is the "blind leading the blind," caused by quietism, known as mediumism, an
opening out of the Ego to (what is called) any external influence, elementals, or disembodied energy.
A transmutated consciousness that is a resistance to "true" sub-conscious activity, it being a voluntary
insanity, a somnambulation of the Ego with "no form" or control to guide it: hence its emanations are
stupid in suggestion, or memories of childhood.

Obsession known as or related to insanity is an experience that is dissociated from the personality
(Ego) through some sort of rejection. It is sub-crystalline, and cannot become permanently attached
to the sub-consciousness, not having exhausted or completed itself by realisation. Depending on its
degree of intensity and resistance shown at some time or another, the Ego has or has not knowledge
of the obsession; always is its expression autonomous, divorced from personal control, power of
direction and timing. Concentration determines dissociation. Enthusiasm for one object seeking
completion by identification, sacrifices all else, or deliberately forgets. Its separation from the Ego (it
becoming equal, or more in bulk than the rest of the consciousness, causes subdivision or "double
personality"), is caused by its own intensity or by shock of resistance determined by some
incompatibility of the desired or desire.

Concentration is dissatisfied desire, a conflict that can never be satisfied, because of its means. When
the Ego, not appearing to have or not knowing the means of fulfilment, seeks its repudiation,
repression, imaginative fulfilment, or transmutation to escape its worry. None of these is the desire's
or obsession's annihilation, but its separation or concealment from the rest of the Ego, its premature
sub-conscious existence. It is held there only when some form of resistance is active, when resistance
is dormant- control is given to the presiding obsession, allowing its incarnation in, and swamping of
the Ego, which has to live and perform its emotional experience. Disease and Insanity (all disease is
insanity) is caused when the disembodied energy has no vital function. It is this energy which is
utilised for the vitalization of Sigils.

**Sigils.**

**The Psychology of Believing.**

ascertained, the study of knowledge is unproductive. Even if "they" were known their study is
useless. We are not the object by the perception, but by becoming it. Closing the gateways of sense is
no help. Verily I will make common-sense the foundation of my teaching. Otherwise, how can I
convey my meaning to the deaf, vision to the blind, and my emotion to the dead? In a labyrinth of
metaphor and words, intuition is lost, therefore without their effort must be learned the truth about
one's self from him who alone knows the truth . . . . yourself.

Of what use the wisdom of Virginity to him who has been raped by the seducer, ignorance? Of what
use sciences or any knowledge except as medicine? Hidden treasure does not come at the word nor
by digging with your hands in the main road. Even with the proper implements and accurate
knowledge of place, etc., may be but the acquisition of what you possessed long ago. There is a great
doubt as to whether it is hidden, except by the strata of your experience and atmospheres of your belief.

The pertinent question now proposed by "Thee" should be asked by those desirous of some measure
of genius. My answer like the mighty germ is in agreement with the universe, simple and full of deep
import and for a time extremely objectionable to your ideas of good and beauty. Listen, attentively,
O! Aspirant, all agog for information, to my answer, for by living the meaning thou shalt truly be
freed from the bondage of constitutional ignorance. Thou must live it thyself; I cannot live it for thee.

The chief cause of genius is realization or "I" by an emotion that allows the lightning assimilation of
what is perceived. This emotion is immoral in that it allows free association of knowledge without the
accessories of belief. Its condition is, therefore, ignorance of "I am" and "I am not" with absentmindedness
as believing. Its most excellent state is the "Neither-Neither," the free or atmospheric "I."

You remember in your youth the thought "that this world is a curious place" in the emotion when
you felt "why" as to whether this life is a reasonable development? What was the cause of this and of
your summarily dismissing it from your mind? Again the feeling that the most commonplace object is
magnificently strange and the vague emotion of co-relation between the incompatible (exhaustive
arguments often see this, but always excuse it); the curiosity and shock with a more intimate
association with the wonders of creation. What is it that prevents you following investigation into
"what exactly is surprise," etc.? What is the cause of your believing more in God than a dog-fight?
Yet you fear dogs more than God! Where is the difference between yourself choked with disquieting
piety, and the innocence of a babe? Perhaps in these is the cause of ignorance.

Belief is the fall from the Absolute. What are you going to believe? Truth seeks its own negation.
Different aspects are not the truth, nor are they necessary to truth. Of its emanations which are you to
strangle at birth? Are you illegitimate? You believe in right and wrong- what punishment will you
determine? Can you escape the driving "Must"? Who can escape boredom- without change? Who
remain single and content! What man among you is large and free enough to encompass his "self"?
Your belief obfuscates lineage. Ambition is smallness- your customed environment. Remember, time
is an unstudied imagination of the experienced. What may be called the early experience was its
completion, so of learning there is no finis. What you learn to-morrow is determined by what you
have done- the accomplished lesson of yesterday. Never learning to-day what you can do to-morrow
is called loss, but is theft from time, wholesomeness and rejuvenescence. Repeat this delay again and
again till you arrive at spontaneity, chance in safety. The pursuit of learning (believing) is the
grotesque incubator of stupidity.

If you could truly believe, we should realise the virtue of it. We are not free to believe . . . . however
much we so desire, having conflicting ideas to first exhaust. Sigils are the art of believing; my
invention for making belief organic, ergo, true belief.

When by the wish to believe- it is of the necessity incompatible with an existing belief and is not
realized through the inhibition of the organic belief- the negation of the wish, faith moves no
mountains, not till it has removed itself. Supposing I wish to be great (is not counting that I am), to
have "faith" and believe that I am, does not make me great- even were I to keep up the pretence to the
end . . . . it being ceremonial insincerity, the affirmation of my incapacity. I am incapable, because
that is the true belief, and organic. To believe differently is but affectation. Therefore the imagination
or "faith" that I am great, is a superficial belief. The reaction and denial, caused by the troublesome
effervescence of the organic incapacity. Denial or faith does not change or annihilate it, but is its
reinforcement and preservation. Therefore belief, to be true, must be organic and sub-conscious. The
desire to be great can only become organic at a time of vacuity, and by giving it (Sigil) form. When
conscious of the Sigil form (any time but the Magical) it should be repressed, a deliberate striving to
forget it, by this it is active and dominates at the unconscious period, its form nourishes and allows it
to become attached to the sub-consciousness and become organic, that accomplished, is its reality
and realization. He becomes his concept of greatness.

So belief becomes true and vital by striving against it in consciousness and by giving it form. Not by
the striving of faith. Belief exhausts itself by confession and non-resistance, i.e., consciousness.
Believe not to believe, and in degree you will obtain its existence. Timeliness depending on your
morality, give to the poor. If the ambitious only knew it is as difficult to become incapable as it is to
become great. They are mutual as accomplishments and equally satisfying.

**The Sub-Consciousness.**

ALL geniuses have active sub-consciousness, and the less they are aware of the fact, the greater their
accomplishments. The sub-consciousness is exploited by desire reaching it. So consciousness should
not contain the "great" desire once the Ego has wished: and should be filled with an affected
ambition for something different, not vice-versa, the inevitable penalty of cowardice lurking
somewhere: surely not an inglorious deceit? Genius, like heroism, is a matter of bravery- you have to
forget fear, or incapacity somehow . . . . hence its expression is always spontaneous. How simple it is
to acquire genius- you know the means; who will take the plunge? The learning of "How" is the
eternal "Why"- unanswered! A genius is such, because he does not know how or why.

**The Storehouse of Memories with an Ever-Open Door.**

Know the sub-consciousness to be an epitome of all experience and wisdom, past incarnations as
men, animals, birds, vegetable life, etc., etc., everything that exists, has and ever will exist. Each
being a stratum in the order of evolution. Naturally then, the lower we probe into these strata, the
earlier will be the forms of life we arrive at; the last is the Almighty Simplicity. And if we succeed in
awakening them, we shall gain their properties, and our accomplishment will correspond. They being
experiences long passed, must be evoked by extremely vague suggestion, which can only operate
when the mind is unusually quiet or simple. To have their wisdom does not mean the necessity of
their bodies- the body modifies in relation to "means" (we travel faster than the hunting leopard, but
do not have its body), when it is the means it changes accordingly. Now, if we observe Nature, the
early forms of life are wonderful in their properties, adaptablility, etc; their strength enormous, and
some are indestructible. No matter what the desire is, it always is its accomplishment. A microbe has
the power to destroy the world (and certainly would if it took an interest in us). If you were to
dismember its limb, the mutilated part would regrow, etc. So by evoking and becoming obsessed or
illuminated by these existences, we gain their magical properties, or the knowledge of their
attainment. This is what already happens (everything happens at all times) though exceedingly
slowly; in striving for knowledge we repel it, the mind works best on a simple diet.

**The Key to Prophecy.**

The law of Evolution is retrogression of function governing progression of attainment, i.e., the more
determined by that desire causing the activity of our bird etc. Karmas. Directly our desire reaches the
stratum belonginging to those existences that can "fly" without wings- so shall we fly without
machines. This sub-conscious activity is the "capacity," the "knowledge"; all other we acquire is of a
negative or manurial value. The virtue of learning and acquiring knowledge by the ordinary means is
in its worry and disappointment, of that degree which causes exhaustion: by that the desire might
accidentally reach the real abode of knowledge, i.e., the sub-consciousness. Inspiration is always at a
void moment, and most great discoveries accidental, usually brought about by exhaustion of the
mind. My formula and Sigils for sub-conscious activity are the means of inspiration, capacity or
genius, and the means of accelerating evolution. An economy of energy and method of learning by
enjoyment. A bat first grew wings and of the proper kind, by its desire being organic enough to reach
the sub-consciousness. If its desire to fly had been conscious, it would have had to wait till it could
have done so by the same means as ourselves, i.e., by machinery. All genius has an hypothesis
(usually natural) in the form of a hobby, which serves to restrain and occupy the conscious mind, to
prevent its interference with spontaneous expression. The great Leonardo's mathematics, etc., served
to "Deceive" him as such an hypothesis (and as Sigils). Our lives are full of the Symbolism of those
predominating Karmas we are governed by. All ornament, useless dress, etc., are such (they please
people because they feel the identification), and the means of locating them (Karmas). The
symbolism of crowning a man King, is that he, resembling God (on earth), has reached the lowest
strata of his sub-consciousness (those one-cell organisms if you like), which predominate as
governing his functions. (Of course, those crowned Kings are never such, they symbolise the "hope,"
not the reality.) Hence the floral nature of and precious stones in design of the crown relate to first
principles. He is King who has reached the dual principle in its simplicity, the first experience which
is all experience . . . . he has no need of crowns and kingdoms.

By Sigils and the acquirement of vacuity, any past incarnation, experience, etc., can be summoned to
consciousness. It may even happen in sleep in the form of dreams, but this means is very difficult.
(Chapters on day and night dreaming for pleasure omitted.)

Total vacuity is difficult and unsafe for those governed by morality, complexes, i.e., whose belief is
not entirely self-love. Hence this desideratum of Sigils, etc.

Know all ritual, ceremony, conditions, as arbitrary (you have yourself to please), a hindrance and
confusion; their origin was for amusement, later for the purpose of deceiving other from knowing the
truth and inducing ignorance; and as always happens their high priests were the more deceived
themselves. He who deceives another deceives himself much more. Therefore know the Charlatans by
their love of rich robes, ceremony, ritual, magical retirements, absurd conditions, and other stupidity,
too numerous to relate. Their entire doctrine a boastful display, a cowardice hungering for notoriety;
their standard everything unnecessary, their certain failure assured. Hence it is that those with some
natural ability quickly lose it by their teaching. They can only dogmatise, implant and multiply that
which is entirely superficial. Were I a teacher I should not act as master, as knowing more, the pupil
could lay no claim to discipleship. Assimilating slowly, he would not be conscious of his learning, he
would not repeat the vital mistake; without fear he would accomplish with ease. The only teaching
possible is to show a man how to learn from his own wisdom, and to utilise his ignorance and
mistakes. Not by obscuring his vision and intention by righteousness.

**Sigils. Belief with Protection.**

**Magickal Obsession.*:

I will now explain their creation and use; there is no difficulty about it, how pure and clear it all is 25.
Out of love for my foolish devotees I invented it. All desire, whether for Pleasure, Knowledge, or
Power, that cannot find "Natural" expression, can by Sigils and their formula find fulfilment from the
sub-consciousness. Sigils are the means of guiding and uniting the partially free belief26 with an
organic desire, its carriage and retention till its purpose served in the sub-conscious self, and its means
of reincarnation in the Ego. All thought can be expressed by form in true relation. Sigils are
monograms of thought, for the government of energy (all heraldry, crests, monograms, are Sigils and
the Karmas they govern), relating to Karma; a mathematical means of symbolising desire and giving it
form that has the virtue of preventing any thought and association on that particular desire (at the
magical time), escaping the detection of the Ego, so that it does not restrain or attach such desire to its
own transitory images, memories and worries, but allows it free passage to the sub-consciousness.

- 25: By this system, you know exactly what (you believe) your Sigil must relate to. If you
used any form stupidly, you might possibly "conjure up" exactly what you did not
want- the mother of insanity, or what always happens then, nothing at all. This being
the only system, any result other than by it is accidental. Also you do not have to dress
up as a traditional magician, wizard or priest, build expensive temples, obtain virgin
parchment, black goat's blood, etc., etc., in fact no theatricals or humbug.
- 26: Free belief or energy, i.e., a disappointed desire, not yet an obsession.

Sigils are made by combining the letters of the alphabet simplified. Illustration27, the word "Woman"
in Sigil form is (example) or (example) or (example) etc. The word tiger (example) or (example) etc.,
etc. The idea being to obtain a simple form which can be easily visualised at will, and has not too
much pictorial relation to the desire. The true method has a much greater virtue, which cannot be
explained briefly, being the secret of thought form, as degrees of suggestion, and what exactly is in a
name. We have now agreed as to how a Sigil is made, and what virtue it has. Verily, what a person
believes by Sigils, is the truth, and is always fulfilled. This system of Sigils is believed by taking it up
as a hobby at a time of great disappointment or sorrow. By Sigils I have endowed fools with wisdom,
made the wise fools, giving health to the sick and weak, disease to the strong, etc. Now, if for some
purpose, you wanted the strength of a tiger- you would make a sentence such as:- "This my wish to
obtain the strength of a tiger." (Message from person who typed up this file: In constructing the
sentence of desire, beginning with "This my will," has been said by some to be more efficacious.)
Sigilized this would be:-

This my wish (illustrative example of this part of the sentence)

To obtain (ditto)

The strength of a Tiger (same as said above)

Combined as one Sigil (example) or (more simplified example).

- 27: There are six methods of Sigils employed in this book, each corresponding to
different strata. The one shown here is illustrative and the fundamental idea of them
all, from which anyone can evolve his own system. Conditions, etc., or necessity
subsequently evolve themselves. Also a person has more power of creation and
originality with a limited means of expression.

Now by virtue of this Sigil you are able to send your desire into the subconsciousness (which
contains all strength); that having happened, it is the desire's realization by the manifestation of the
knowledge or power necessary.

First, all consciousness except of the Sigil has to be annulled; do not confuse this with
concentration- you simply conceive the Sigil any moment you begin to think. Vacuity 28 is obtained
by exhausting the mind and body by some means or another. A personal or traditional means serves
equally well, depending on temperament; choose the most pleasant; these should be held in favour,
Mantras and Posture, Women and Wine, Tennis, and the playing of Patience, or by walking and
concentration on the Sigil, etc., etc. None is necessary to him who has (even symbolically) for a
moment by the "Neither-Neither" conquered the dual principle (Conception), his Ego is free from
gravity. If the Sigil is made an obsession by continual apprehension, its realization may happen at any
moment, in the form of inspiration. This is done by reverting the mind to the Sigil when one is
extremely worried- the time of exhaustion is the time of fulfilment. At the time of exhaustion or
vacuity, retain only and visualize the Sigil form- eventually it becomes vague, then vanishes and
success is assured. by the Ego conceiving only the Sigil, and not being able to conceive anything from
it, all energy is focussed through it, the desire for identification carries it to the corresponding subconscious
stratum, its destination. The Sigil being a vehicle, serves the purpose of protecting
consciousness from the direct manifestation of the (consciously unacknowledged) obsession, conflict
is avoided with any incompatible ideas and neither gains separate personality. It (the obsession) is
either gradually assimilated and becomes organic or returns to its original abode, its purpose of
illumination served. Hence the mind, by Sigils, depending upon the intensity of desire, is illuminated
or obsessed (knowledge or power) from that particular Karma (the sub-conscious stratum, a
particular existence and knowledge gained by it) relative to the desire, but not from memory or
experience which was recent. Knowledge is obtained by the sensation, resulting from the unity of the
desire and Karma. Power, by its "actual" vitalization and resurrection.

- 28: This is not the passivity of mediumism which opens the mind to what is called
external influence- disembodied energy usually having no better purpose than to raptables.
There are many means of attaining this state of vacuity: I mention the most
simple, there is no need for crucifixion. Drugs are useless. Smoking and laziness the
more difficult.

This knowledge leaves its stratum in company with the energy or desire returning to the Ego. It
escapes the Ego's resistance by associating with similar images, memories, or experiences relative
(recieved in this life), that the mind contains, and crystalizes itself by their symbolism. Hence most
illumination is symbolic, and must be subsequently translated.

**On Myself.**

Conceiving, thou hast given no sign of life. In claiming thee, a labour of creating value, is nothing
worth holding, nothing satisfying; the realization of thy inhibition all? By self-effacement would
seem reality. This self, how empty! how prolific of incompleteness! In self-denial its stimulation to
simulate reality . . . . more and more comes out- these ugly mists of illusion are parental, the cause of
Heaven's hatred! That is why I fear to believe in God, subordination to an attribute, an idea of Self is
not freedom of love! Probably Almighty is he who is unconscious of the idea of God. Now may the
fierceness of my unity be "Thy" silence and for me no longer a query or labour to espouse my doubt.
Yet mankind for ever doubts, quirks, and for every pleasure pays, till he becomes millionary: the
punishment shall fit the appraisement of his capitalization, there is that fear! The rich in dross, to
cheat his conscience, affects humility, speaks of himself as "poor," his possessions as "burdens," or of
"small account"! Of what consolation the truth in the day of weary waiting and watching, the restless
striving, the imprisonment, the rack, the horrors of every conceivable torture? When he becomes
accustomed, loses reality, and no longer deterred, will he then create God and miseries afresh? Oh,
folly of the world, deny thy faith, renounce this Bloody-Sceptred God and confess. The completion
of folly is the beginning of childhood, but of knowledge there is no end. It was the straying that
found the path direct. From childhood, I have never denied my invincible purpose. Oh, silent
watcher, thou sleepless eye of the Universe, watch over the beginning of all my ideas. The misery of
the world would seem eternal, whilst I, in the midst, like an infant not yet smiling, am impervious in
purity (of self-love) but I dare not claim its service! I am in eternal want of realization, poor though I
be, my contentment is beyond your understanding. An opinionist, I fear to advocate an argument, or
compromise myself by believing my own doctrines as such . . . .may they ever be their own
expurgers! Fearsome of knowledge, may my belief be its emptiness, yea, ignorance! From my daring
to believe religions, doctrines, creeds, so shall I hold the jewel of truth. So cautios am I,
simultaneously do I deny that which I affirm, and hold fast to the "not-necessity," by paradox
superseded, without antecedent, spontaneous, I revert to the Absolute, watch my intoxication and
control- the reaction of Karma. How easy is the Way, it would seem as though nothing should be said
but all unsaid! May my words be few and pregnant! Alas, the futility of the idea of God has not yet
reached its limit, all men liars, appear striving for insanity as its climax: while I alone as one
prematurely aged, reason tottering on its throne, remain sane, in positive chastity, confessing no
conscience, no morals- a virgin in singleness of purpose.
