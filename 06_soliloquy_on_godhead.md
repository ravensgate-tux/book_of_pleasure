🇯🇵 停滞した自己催眠が生み出す、濁った敵（神性についての独白）

自然な信念とは、「経験されたこと」によって反応し、交互に支配しあう直観的な衝動である。すべての事物は、自身の明確な感情を通じて他のものと結びつこうとし、それが調和するものに刺激され、調和しないものは力を失い、抑制される。こうして信念は、その仕組みによって自ら制限され、あなたに定められることになる。私たちの行動の大半は、「自由への潜在的な欲望」と「習慣」との葛藤に由来しており、それはまた「すでに犯した善悪の行為（前世において）」に対する内在的な宿命論への従属でもある。そしてその宿命論は、保持された道徳観に従いながら、「自発性」「無意識性」「自主性」「意図的な選択」といったかたちで、状況に応じて表出するのだ。

残りの信念体系は、伝統的な道徳教義との葛藤に由来するものであり、それはすでに「体制の一部」となって反応や行動のタイミングを管理しようとしている。もともとは、「当時の都合」によって便宜的に定義された〈善〉と〈悪〉の観念だった。その目的は、欲望の「抑圧」と「実行」との間で恣意的に折り合いをつけることで快楽を最大化しようとするものであり、同時にその欲望を恐れている。これらは「神聖な起源」を持つかのように見せかけられ、人々に受け入れられてきた。この道徳コードは、「従順には報酬を、違反には罰を」という原則を基盤としており、それが「この世界」と「来世」の両方に当てはまるとされている。だが実際には、これは「概念形成能力（コンセプティヴ・ファカルティ）」を誇張し演出した茶番劇であり、決して完璧でも単純でもない。変化の余地を残すことができないため、この道徳体系は進化から切り離され、機能を失っていく。そしてその存続と共感を得るために、矛盾や複雑化という形で関係性をでっち上げざるを得なくなるのだ。

人は、戒律（コマンドメント）を破ったとき、不誠実さを通じてその不正義（イニクィティ）を自らに示し、正当化しようとする。あるいは同時に、罪を犯す理由や言い訳を──その道徳コードを歪めることによって創り出す。そこには何らかの矛盾が生まれる。（通常は、「赦されざる罪」を数個だけ残し、“書かれていない法”を持ち出しておくのだ。）この“否定的な告白”は、表向きには理性的なふりをした自己欺瞞であり、突発的な言い訳を作るプロセスでもある。──それは、自分自身を正しいと納得させるための方便にすぎない。だが、問いたい。「自己愛（Self-Love）」以外に、私たちにどんな言い訳があるだろう？私たちは、都合のよい道徳──すなわち成長を促し、単純さを保ち、「破ることができるが、罰や言い訳を必要としない」ような道徳──を創りもしなければ、認めようともしない。だが、それを持つことこそが賢明で、常識的な態度なのだ。──たとえ、あなたの心の状態がどうであろうとも。自然は、やがて自ら肯定したものを否定する。同じ道徳コードにずっと縛られ続けることで、私たちは欲望を破滅（トランスグレッション）へと向かわせてしまう。禁じられたものを欲する──それが欲望というものだ。

抑圧すればするほど、罪は増す。しかし同時に、欲望そのものが“道徳本能の保持”を求めてもいる。つまり──欲望とは、その内部に矛盾を抱えたものなのだ。（そして、その矛盾は意外と弱々しい。）恐れることはない。地の牡牛（バアル、物質の象徴）は、すでにあなたの“汚れた良心”や、停滞した道徳観とは何の関わりも持っていない。いまや恐れるものがあるとすれば、唯一、微生物microbe）だけかもしれない。

**The Complexity of the Belief (Know Thyself).**

The nature of belief equals all possibilities ultimately true by identification through culture to an idea
of time, so what is not timely is not true, and what is not true, prognostication. Thought of one thing,
implies the possibility of another idea as contradicting but not dissociated, belief is to make "one"
more convincing. The condition of belief is the denial or limit imposed on the capability of the
vitality. To believe at all as such is a concentration and schooling to exclude the implied by adopting
a hypothesis or faith that reflects non-worryingly or deceitfully rationalizes the rejected. Truth is not
the truth of formula.

The centre of belief is love for one's self, projecting environment for fulfilment but allowing its
distortion to simulate denial, an ambition to become ulterior to self-desire, but you cannot get further
than the centre, so one multiplies (believes) in order to be more unaware of the fundamental. Now
this refusal to believe what one believes and exactly as one believes, is the first condition for all those
who are in desire in any sense whatsoever; the man who is in love perforce becomes a liar, selfhypnotised
by his morbid ornamentation. You know the results. . . . .You can only "truly believe"
one thing, yet its implexion is essential (as the truth seems to kill 12), so the imagined goes on for
ever. The imagination learns that the idea is its compulsion. To explain the "why" of belief (or of
anything else), we must transcend its schism. By entire consciousness in how the self loves is the
means. As we imitate this law of duality in all our processes of believing, it is not so simple as it
seems. Who has transgressed the law of conception? Who has no fear? Yet by this sin, is the sciential
of what determines the Schetic. Gracefully compelling or expecting disappointment at the time of
desire is the means of locating its deceit, a consciousness that alone gives the chance of inquiry.
Beyond it is something arbitrary, the pauser, the ordainer of law, imitating it by "reason" is but
damning the consequences. Reason is belief, belief is fear of one's capability, the faith that you are
not even all the wonders of creation, let alone the possibility of being the creator. It is delay . . . .
Belief well earns the terrible hatred of the vitality. Belief is not freedom. Belief creates its necessary
experience, progress germinates in retrogression. Consider the reality is somewhere: and your belief
may be too small for its habitation. Oh, ye of much faith in God, merge into it by the worship of self!
Ah! foolish man, worship the glorious in freedom. When death approaches the faith in God and
desire of woman will not save you, what are their use when withering and decay sets in and the body
is an object of disgust? And what is the use of knowledge and charity when reality is known?
Unsheathe the sword of self; ideas of the Almighty should be constantly slain and righteousness
should be inquired into.

- 12: And does kill when feared.

Whosoever shall study his true nature a little, him does the "self" investigate with his extraordinary
conduct. He can compel anything without offending. As the tendency of the most lustful ceases
before publicity and death, so do morals and faith before the perfect bliss. A glimpse of the truth is
born of purity of love: when the desire is without fear, when it does not desire possession. When the
thought is fulfilled by vision. The fire that is all pleasure is loosed at his will, he is attraction, the
cynosure of women. When the believing principle is devoid of faith, as sterile of possessing ideas of
God - he is indestructible. Only when there is no fear in any form is there realisation of identity with
reality (freedom). For them there is no danger in negligence, there being no discrimination. For him
who is conscious of the slightest differentiation there is fear. So long as there is perception of selfreproach
or conscience, there is pain germinating: there is no freedom. He who believes anything he
perceives or imagines, falls into sin. By believing without feeling perturbation, forgetting ideas of
external and internal, he regards everything as self, and is the consciousness of non-resistance, has no
horizon: he is free. On seeing the star-lit eyes and rosebud mouths, the breasts and loins of beautiful
women, you become lovingly attached, but if you fear, consider constantly that they are merely the
charred flesh and bones of yourself after the torture. The space between the eternal and "self," is it
not a moral doctrine? By unbelieving all one believes and sedulously without anxiety not believing
(by the "Neither-Neither" process), the principle becomes simple and cosmic enough to include what
you are always desiring, and you are free to believe what was impossible. The desire is so mighty, it
asks no permission, and suffers no consequences, but the ecstasy of its possession. Against it nothing
can prevail, it burns up, as celluloid cast into the furnace- the old folly of promising things on behalf
of an imagined "another." At hand is the freedom of Heaven, the Way, the Truth, and the Light, and
none dare say this of himself but by me, in Truth I alone am "Self," my will unconditioned, is
magical. Those who have lived much in their nature will in some degree be familiar with such a
sensation, poor though it be.
