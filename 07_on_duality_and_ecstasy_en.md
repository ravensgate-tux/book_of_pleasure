🇬🇧 Preface to Self-Love

Let us be honest! Thou art "that," supreme in freedom, most desirable, beyond desire, untouched by
the six stupifiers. The sexuality labours, so Death may harvest by desire. The elusive fancies of the
senses are dangerous, because of the righteousness you have learned to obey and control them by.
Hell-fire burns because you "conceived"; and will cease to hurt when you identify the Ego with all
the possibilities of its qualities by believing as the "Neither-Neither" process. You are fire yet you are
scorched! Because you have "willed" belief (differently or not makes no difference); the cycle of
belief goes on and always obliges, so one day you must believe differently and the fire will no longer
hurt- you are saved? There are other means of hurting you?

In that state which is not, there is no consciousness in any sense that thou art "that" (Kia), which is
superb, beyond the range of definition: there is no temptation of freedom, "it" was not the cause of
evolution. Hence "it" is beyond time, consciousness or unconsciousness, everything or nothingness,
etc.; this I know through the "Neither-Neither" which is automatically beyond every conception, ever
free in every sense. Perhaps "it" may not be obscure by continual afterthought and vaguely felt
through the hand of innocence- but whoever understands such simple meanings? "It" is never
perceived, being the imperceptible Ecstasy of the "Neither-Neither"- ever present but hidden by
exhaustion through the cycle of Unity. The certainty of consciousness is always the uncertainty of the
perceived or experienced in whatever state it may be, the constant doubt spelling fear, pain, decay,
and the like- the cause of evolution, the eternal incompletion.

O, desire, listen! In point of virulence spiritual desire is as fatal as the sensuous. Aspiration towards a
"supreme" is a network of deadly desires because of cowardice within, ergo, some unsatisfied wisdom

awaiting exploitation to suffer its evolutions. There is no final wisdom- there is no final desire. How
can anything end? Has to-day ever ended? These things are endlessness!
A person desires things of this world- but where is the difference of desiring the "Supreme Bliss"?
Which is the more selfish? Which is nearer you? Which pleases the Creator more? Are you certain of
the Creator's will and are you sure of your own desire? Are you the Creator or just yourself, as you
fondly imagine your contents?
All these desires, however mighty, you will one day incarnate- yea, photograph. These things already
exist- very soon you will have spiritual photographs (unfaked) but not by the camera you use at
present. The pioneer is ever the old fool. An afterthought: some spirits are already photographed- the
microbes.

Are you ever free of desideratum? Belief is eternal desire!

Desire is its own cruelty, the fettering of the hand to labour in some world unknown; nothing is
always dead and no thought dies, the master becomes the slave- the position is alternate; you have
long believed this, it is in the flesh of your generations with the most merciless Judge! The scorn of
all your reforms or the inversion of your values!

This constant curse and blasphemy- is not the relief more in the knowledge of the nascent
unrelenting taskmaster?

Are not our bodies all smeared with its blood? Has not the world ever been bloody? Are not our
pleasures but rest to drink the blood of slaughter? O, determined Liars, ye know not yet the lie, it
may be Truth!

The Ego is desire, so everything is ultimately desired and undesirable, desire is ever a preliminary
forecast of terrible dissatisfaction hidden by its ever-present vainglory. The millenium will come and
quickly go. Men will be greater than the Gods they ever conceived- there will be greater
dissatisfaction. You are ever what you were but you may be so in a different form!

A person or a nation, however vain or content, falls immediately into unknown and inevitable desire,
consuming him little by little through those conditions- any condition!

The mind becomes firm in desire by desire as devotion, but when realized is it then eternally
desirable? (or even for a period of a million years). In Heaven shall be fettered thy foot! Therefore
remove the conception that desire is pure, or impure, or has completion- remove it by the "Neither-
Neither." Even whether the desire is for the exhasustion of desire by the "neither-Neither" or for
realization in a wife- it is desire- its unending evolution. Therefore remove desire in any form by the
"Neither-Neither." Remove the illusion that there is Spirit and Not-Spirit (this idea has never given
beneficial results). Remove all conceptions by the same means.

So long as the notion remains that there is "compulsory bondage" in this World or even in dreams
there is such bondage. Remove the conception of Freedom and Bondage in any World or State by
meditation on Freedom in Freedom by the **"Neither-Neither."**

For this we know- Vampirism is quite well proven enough- even by the strong presumption that 
whenever blood-sucking is done, it is done by Vampire bats apart from the probability of it being
done by a divine or human agency!

Therefore Kiaize desire by the "Neither-Neither," the most excellent formula far beyond
contentment- the all-embracing vacuum which reduces "all" to common sense and upon which this
Universe rests.

Therefore believe nothing in this Book by the "Neither-Neither," and dispel the conception of the
"Neither-Neither" by the "Neither-Neither," and belive it is "not-necessary" or the conclusion of
pleasing yourself, because it "Need-not-be-Does-not-matter."

One believes this "all the time" as the Truth of "The Will" not the thing believed, since the means to
an end mean evolution to endless means.

In that most remarkable simplicity there is no beginning or end of wisdom or of anything, so how can
it be related to conception and intelligence?

**Self-Love as a Moral Doctrine and Virtue.**

The criterion of action, is freedom of movement, timeliness of expression, pleasuring. The value of a
moral doctrine is in its freedom for transgression. Simplicity I hold most precious. Are not the most
simple things in the world the most perfect, pure, innocent, and their properties the most wonderful?
Hence it is the source of wisdom. Wisdom is exactly happiness. In love pleasuring myself necessarily
without excuse. Is this not perfection? Actions would appear unfathomable and incomprehensible,
did they exhibit conformity to the great purpose. There are few who can attain to this! Who has no
shame? Ecstasy in satisfaction is the great purpose. Freedom from the necessity of law, realisation by
the very wish, is the ultimate goal. Law depends on two, two is uberty, millions . . . . Law is
complicated. The second did not agitate, the first did not determine, nor was it compelled or
proffered. Chance in sport is not prophecy; by it we have gained proficiency, sufficient to determine.
. . . .

Prepare for the Eternal, revert to simplicity and you are free. What man can give without
impulse? Only he who has complete sexuality. The highest goodness is self-nourishment. What are
we going to include as self? Perfect charity acquires, hence it benefits all things by not giving. What
man can have faith without fear? Only he who has no duty to perform. When faith perishes duty to
moral doctrines perishes, we are without sin and endure for ever in all-devouring love. What man can
know with certainty? Only he who has effaced the necessity of learning. When teachers fall out, what
is the use of learning from them? The wise are not contentious and have no dogma to expound . . . .
rather are they silent as a new-born babe in feeding. What teacher can show the source of wisdom? It
is because I know without learning; I know the source and can convey lessons without teaching.
Knowledge is but the excrement of experience: experience its own repetition. The true teacher
implants no knowledge but shows him his own superabundance. Keeping his vision clear he directs
or leads him as a child to the essential. Having shown him the source of wisdom, he retires before
gratitude or sentiment sets in, leaving him to fertilize as he wishes. Is not this the way of Heaven? He
who trusts to his natural fund of genius, has no knowledge of its extent and accomplishes with ease,
but directly he doubts, ignorance obsesses him. Doubt fertilizes in the virgin soil. He is no longer
fearless but a coward to difficulties, his very learning is fear. The difference between genius and
ignorance is a degree of fear. The beginning of wisdom is fear of forethought the reception of

knowledge in learning. Children doubt, and abhor learning. Why, even the affection of courage
results in cleverness! The difference between good and evil is a matter of profundity. Which is nearer
you, self-love and its immorality or love and morals? Not conscious of desert the compeer of Heaven,
and constant happiness in wisdom is the capacity of direction. From self-glorification, from selfexaltation
we rise superior to the incapacity of disquieting fear: the ridiculer to destruction of
humility in repentance. This "self-love" that does not give but is glad to receive is the genuine
opportunity for freedom from covetousness, from the militant amusement of Heaven. He who
subordinates animal instincts to reason, quickly loses control. Are not the animals we see in circuses
trained by torture? And do not the animals reared in love, slay their master? The wise embraces and
nourishes all things, but does not act as master. Only when passions are ruled by foreign environment
are they dangers. Control is by leaving things to work out their own salvation- directly we interfere
we become identified with and subject to their desire. When the Ego sees self-love- there is peace it
becomes the seer. Directly we desire, we have lost all; "we are" what we desire, therefore we never
obtain. Desire nothing, and there is nothing that you shall not realise. Desire is for completion, the
inherent emotion that it is "all happiness," all wisdom, in constant harmony. But directly we believe,
we are liars- and become identified with pain, yet pain and pleasure are one and the same. Therefore
believe nothing, and you will have reverted to a simplicity which childhood has not yet attained. The
fool asks how? as we must believe in pleasure and pain. Now if we could suffer them simultaneously
(pain and pleasure) and hold fast to a principle that ascends, that allows the Ego vibration above
them, should we not have reached the ecstasy? Now the belief is the "Ego," yet separates it from
Heaven as your body separates you from another's. . . . . Therefore by retaining the belief in the "not
necessity" (when conceiving), the Ego is free. The emotion of laughter is exhaustion, the early
suffering hence by making this emotion a "mental state" at the time of unity13 he unites pain and
pleasure, suffers them simultaneously and by the "not necessity" of his belief, his conception
transcends this world and reaches the absolute ecstasy. There is no place where pain or death can enter.

- 13: Of Sex, indeed of everything.

The idea of God is the primordial sin, all religions are evil. Self-love is its own law, which may be
broken with impunity, being the only energy that is not servile, serving its ever-ready purpose. Surely
it is all that is left us that has no sin and is free? Verily, it is the only thing we dare be conscious of.
He that truly pleases himself is wihout virtue, and shall satisfy all men. Hate, jealousy, murder, etc.,
are conditions of love, even as virtue, greed, selfishness, suicide, etc., are conditions or not pleasing
ones's self. There is no sin more sickening than love, for it is the very essence of covetousness and the
mother of all sin, hence it has the most devotees. Self-love only is pure and without a congregation.
He that entirely loves himself induces self-love only. In this he is inexorable, but does not offend like
other men. He is akin to the great purpose, his actions explained for him, good seen of his evil,
without knowing, everyone satisfied with his will. Do not Heaven and Earth unite daily in
spontaneous homage to this will of self-love? No man can show greater self-love, than by giving up
all he believes. Why do I value this self-love before all else? Is it not because I may be free to believe
in evil, but have no thought that anything can do me injury? All is self-love, the people of the world,
if they only knew, are its devotees. My new law is the great clue to life. If the world could
understand this, the rotten fabric discarded, they would diligently follow the way in their own hearts,
there would be no further desire for unity. . . . . Try and imagine what that implies.

May the idea of God perish and with it women: have they not both made me appear clownish? 
Let there be no mistake, purity and innocence is simplicity, happiness is wisdom. What is simple has no
duality.

**The Doctrine of Eternal Self-Love.**

Now self-love is explained. It is the completion of belief. The "self" is the "Neither-Neither," nothing
omitted, indissoluble, beyond prepossession; dissociation of conception by its own invincible love is
the only true, safe, and free. The desire, will, and belief ceasing to exist as separate. Attraction,
repulsion, and control self contained, they become the original unity, inert in pleasure. There is no
duality. There is no desire for unity. At that time, it (the dual principle) rests in its unmodified state.
The belief no longer subject to conception by conceiving "self" as such by loving. At other times, it14
creates a centre, becomes its environment, identified with its ramifications, conception created,
subjection to law and the insatiable desire for unity, inasmuch as the duality is unity. Servitude to
law is the hatred of Heaven. Self-love only is the eternal all pleasing, by meditation on this effulgent
self which is mystic joyousness. At that time of bliss, he is punctual to his imagination, in that day
what happiness is his! A lusty innocent, beyond sin, without hurt! Balanced by an emotion, a
refraction of his ecstasy is all that he is conscious of as external.15 His vacuity causes double
refraction, "He," the self-effulgent lightens in the Ego. Beyond law and the guest at the "Feast of the
Supersensualists." 16 He has power over life and death. 17 Save by this, he is not beyond selfreproach,
verily he has loosed all the trouble of the world, the murder from the lightning. Self-love
preventing the mind from concentration, is identity without form, is no thought as such; law and
external influences contained, do not affect. When that giving up all belief, reflects only its meaning,
then is there purity of vision, innocence of touch, ergo, self-love. Verily, verily men are born, suffer
and die through their belief. Ejaculation is death. Self-love is preservation and life.

- 14: It the "Neither-Neither" emanates tetragrammaton of relatives, the sexes of which
are evolved through their cruciform reflection and are elusive to identity. In their
XXXX they produce unity XXXXX XXXXX conception. Ego generating by subdivision
they embrace eternity, in their manifold ramifications is law.
- 15: i.e. his rainbow.
- 16: Chapter on self-attraction omitted.
- 17: This is the test. The one who doubt would naturally submit himself.

Man to invoke pleasure in his choice, subtracts from desire, his desire is partial desire, becomes subduple
(conflict), never is his energy full. Having no true focus, he is deceived in his strength and
attains a pure measure of pleasure from his body. In success how heavy is his sentence! Pleasure
becomes the illusion. Through dire necessity, "his means," he is bound to its cause and effect, and
becomes a holcaust on the pyre of sentiment. This self-love is the only full energy, all else a
wrapping of dissatisfaction, the hypothesis of desires which obscures.
Man in the misery of his illusions and unsatisfied desires, wings his flight to different religions, and
doctrines, seeks redeception, a hypnotic, a palliative from which he suffers fresh miseries in

exhaustion. The terms of the cure are new illusions, greater entanglement, more stagnant
environment.
Having studied all ways and means to pleasure and pondered over them well again and again, this
self-love has been found by me to be the only free, true and full one, nothing more sane, pure, and
complete. There is no deceit: when by this all experience certainly is known, everything sublimely
beautiful and exceedingly amiable: where is the necessity of other means? Like the drink to the
drunkard everything should be sacrificed for it. This Self-love is now declared by me the means of
evolving millions of ideas for pleasure without love, or its synonyms- self-reproach, sickness, old-age,
and death. The Symposium of self and love. O! Wise Man, Please Thyself.
