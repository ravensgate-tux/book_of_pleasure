🇬🇧 Definitions

The words God, religions, faith, morals, woman, etc. (they being forms of belief), are used as
expressing different "means" as controlling and expressing desire: an idea of unity by fear in some
form or another which must spell bondage-the imagined limits; extended by science which adds a
dearly paid inch to our height: no more.
Kia: The absolute freedom which being free is mighty enough to be "reality" and free at any time:
therefore is not potential or manifest (except as it's instant possibility) by ideas of freedom or
"means," but by the Ego being free to recieve it, by being free of ideas about it and by not believing.
The less said of it (Kia) the less obscure is it. Remember evolution teaches by terrible punishmentsthat
conception is ultimate reality but not ultimate freedom from evolution.
Virtue: Pure Art
Vice: Fear, belief, faith, control, science, and the like.
Self-Love: A mental state, mood or condition caused by the emotion of laughter becoming the
principle that allows the Ego appreciation or universal association in permitting inclusion before
conception.
Exhaustion: That state of vacuity brought by exhausting a desire by some means of dissipation when
the mood corresponds to the nature of the desire, i.e., when the mind is worried because of the nonfulfilment
of such desire and seeks relief. By seizing this mood and living, the resultant vacuity is
sensitive to the subtle suggestion of the Sigil.
